PROLOGUE


  Two households, both alike in dignity,
    In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
  From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
    Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
  From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life,
  Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
    Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.

  The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
   And the continuance of their parents' rage,
  Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
   Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage,
  The which if you with patient ears attend,
  What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.




ACT I


SCENE I. _Verona. A Public Place_.


_Enter_ SAMPSON _and_ GREGORY, _of the house of Capulet, with swords and
bucklers_

  _Sampson._ Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry
  coals.

  _Gregory._ No, for then we should be colliers.

  _Sampson._ I mean, an we be in choler we'll draw.

  _Gregory._ Ay, while you live, draw your neck out
  o' the collar.

  _Sampson._ I strike quickly, being moved.

  _Gregory._ But thou art not quickly moved to strike.

  _Sampson._ A dog of the house of Montague moves
  me.                                                               10

  _Gregory._ To move is to stir, and to be valiant is
  to stand; therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st
  away.

  _Sampson._ A dog of that house shall move me to
  stand; I will take the wall of any man or maid of
  Montague's.

  _Gregory._ That shows thee a weak slave; for the
  weakest goes to the wall.

  _Sampson._ True; and therefore women, being the
  weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore            20
  I will push Montague's men from the wall, and
  thrust his maids to the wall.

  _Gregory._ The quarrel is between our masters and
  us their men.

  _Sampson._ 'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant;
  when I have fought with the men, I will be cruel
  with the maids and cut off their heads.

  _Gregory._ Draw thy tool; here comes two of the
  house of the Montagues.

  _Sampson._ My naked weapon is out; quarrel, I                     30
  will back thee.

  _Gregory._ How? turn thy back and run?

  _Sampson._ Fear me not.

  _Gregory._ No, marry; I fear thee!

  _Sampson._ Let us take the law of our sides; let
  them begin.

  _Gregory._ I will frown as I pass by, and let them
  take it as they list.

  _Sampson._ Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb
  at them, which is a disgrace to them if they bear it.             40

_Enter_ ABRAM _and_ BALTHASAR

  _Abram._ Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

  _Sampson._ I do bite my thumb, sir.

  _Abram._ Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

  _Sampson._ [_Aside to Gregory_] Is the law of our
  side, if I say ay?

  _Gregory._ No.

  _Sampson._ No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you,
  sir, but I bite my thumb, sir.

  _Gregory._ Do you quarrel, sir?

  _Abram._ Quarrel, sir! no, sir.                                   50

  _Sampson._ If you do, sir, I am for you; I serve as
  good a man as you.

  _Abram._ No better.

  _Sampson._ Well, sir.

  _Gregory._ [_Aside to Sampson_] Say 'better'; here
  comes one of my master's kinsmen.

  _Sampson._ Yes, better, sir.

  _Abram._ You lie.

  _Sampson._ Draw, if you be men.--Gregory, remember
  thy swashing blow.                               [_They fight._   60

_Enter_ BENVOLIO

  _Benvolio._ Part, fools!
  Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
                                        [_Beats down their swords._

_Enter_ TYBALT

  _Tybalt._ What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
  Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.

  _Benvolio._ I do but keep the peace; put up thy sword,
  Or manage it to part these men with me.

  _Tybalt._ What, drawn and talk of peace! I hate the word,
  As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee;
  Have at thee, coward!
                                                     [_They fight._

_Enter several of both houses who join the fray; then enter_ Citizens,
_with clubs_

  _First Citizen_. Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down! 70
  Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!

_Enter_ CAPULET _in his gown, and_ LADY CAPULET

  _Capulet._ What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!

  _Lady Capulet_. A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?

  _Capulet._ My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
  And flourishes his blade in spite of me.

_Enter_ MONTAGUE _and_ LADY MONTAGUE

  _Montague._ Thou villain Capulet!--Hold me not, let me go.

  _Lady Montague._ Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.

_Enter_ PRINCE, _with his train_

  _Prince._ Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
  Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,                80
  That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
  With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
  On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
  Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
  And hear the sentence of your moved prince.--
  Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
  By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
  Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
  And made Verona's ancient citizens
  Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,                          90
  To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
  Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate.
  If ever you disturb our streets again,
  Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.--
  For this time, all the rest depart away.--
  You, Capulet, shall go along with me;--
  And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
  To know our further pleasure in this case,
  To old Freetown, our common judgment-place.--
  Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.                     100
           [_Exeunt all but Montague, Lady Montague, and Benvolio._

  _Montague._ Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
  Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?

  _Benvolio._ Here were the servants of your adversary
  And yours close fighting ere I did approach.
  I drew to part them; in the instant came
  The fiery Tybalt with his sword prepar'd,
  Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,
  He swung about his head and cut the winds,
  Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.
  While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,                   110
  Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
  Till the prince came, who parted either part.

  _Lady Montague._ O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
  Right glad I am he was not at this fray.

  _Benvolio._ Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
  Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
  A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
  Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
  That westward rooteth from the city's side,
  So early walking did I see your son.                             120
  Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
  And stole into the covert of the wood;
  I, measuring his affections by my own,
  Which then most sought where most might not be found,
  Being one too many by my weary self,
  Pursued my humour, not pursuing his,
  And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.

  _Montague._ Many a morning hath he there been seen,
  With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,
  Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;                130
  But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
  Should in the farthest east begin to draw
  The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
  Away from light steals home my heavy son,
  And private in his chamber pens himself,
  Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,
  And makes himself an artificial night.
  Black and portentous must this humour prove,
  Unless good counsel may the cause remove.                        139

  _Benvolio._ My noble uncle, do you know the cause?

  _Montague._ I neither know it nor can learn of him.

  _Benvolio._ Have you importun'd him by any means?

  _Montague._ Both by myself and many other friends;
  But he, his own affections' counsellor,
  Is to himself--I will not say how true--
  But to himself so secret and so close,
  So far from sounding and discovery,
  As is the bud bit with an envious worm
  Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
  Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.                               150
  Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
  We would as willingly give cure as know.

_Enter_ ROMEO

  _Benvolio._ See, where he comes! So please you, step aside;
  I'll know his grievance or be much denied.

  _Montague._ I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
  To hear true shrift.--Come, madam, let's away.
                                       [_Exeunt Montague and Lady._

  _Benvolio._ Good morrow, cousin.

  _Romeo._                         Is the day so young?

  _Benvolio._ But new struck nine.

  _Romeo._                         Ay me! sad hours seem long.
  Was that my father that went hence so fast?

  _Benvolio._ It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?        160

  _Romeo._ Not having that which, having, makes them short.

  _Benvolio._ In love?

  _Romeo._ Out--

  _Benvolio._ Of love?

  _Romeo._ Out of her favour where I am in love.

  _Benvolio._ Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
  Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!

  _Romeo._ Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
  Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
  Where shall we dine?--O me! What fray was here?
  Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.                        171
  Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
  Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
  O any thing, of nothing first created!
  O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
  Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
  Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
  Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
  This love feel I that feel no love in this.
  Dost thou not laugh?

  _Benvolio._                   No, coz, I rather weep.            180

  _Romeo._ Good heart, at what?

  _Benvolio._                   At thy good heart's oppression.

  _Romeo._ Why, such is love's transgression.
  Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
  Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
  With more of thine; this love that thou hast shown
  Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
  Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;
  Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
  Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.
  What is it else? a madness most discreet,                        190
  A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
  Farewell, my coz.

  _Benvolio._       Soft! I will go along;
  An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.

  _Romeo._ Tut, I have lost myself, I am not here;
  This is not Romeo, he's some other where.

  _Benvolio._ Tell me in sadness who is that you love.

  _Romeo._ What, shall I groan and tell thee?

  _Benvolio._                       Groan! why, no,
  But sadly tell me who.

  _Romeo._ Bid a sick man in sadness make his will;
  Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!                        200
  In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

  _Benvolio._ I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.

  _Romeo._ A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.

  _Benvolio._ A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

  _Romeo._ Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit
  With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit,
  And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
  From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
  She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
  Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,                        210
  Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
  O, she is rich in beauty! only poor
  That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.

  _Benvolio._ Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?

  _Romeo._ She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
  For beauty starv'd with her severity
  Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
  She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
  To merit bliss by making me despair;
  She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow                       220
  Do I live dead that live to tell it now.

  _Benvolio._ Be rul'd by me, forget to think of her.

  _Romeo._ O, teach me how I should forget to think.

  _Benvolio._ By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
  Examine other beauties.

  _Romeo._                         'Tis the way
  To call hers, exquisite, in question more.
  These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,
  Being black, put us in mind they hide the fair.
  He that is strucken blind cannot forget
  The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.                      230
  Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
  What doth her beauty serve but as a note
  Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
  Farewell; thou canst not teach me to forget.

  _Benvolio._ I'll pay that doctrine or else die in debt.
                                                         [_Exeunt._


SCENE II. _A Street_

_Enter_ CAPULET, PARIS, _and_ Servant

  _Capulet._ But Montague is bound as well as I,
  In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
  For men so old as we to keep the peace.

  _Paris._ Of honourable reckoning are you both,
  And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.
  But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?

  _Capulet._ But saying o'er what I have said before.
  My child is yet a stranger in the world;
  She hath not seen the change of fourteen years.
  Let two more summers wither in their pride                        10
  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

  _Paris._ Younger than she are happy mothers made.

  _Capulet._ And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
  The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
  She is the hopeful lady of my earth.
  But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
  My will to her consent is but a part;
  An she agree, within her scope of choice
  Lies my consent and fair according voice.
  This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,                        20
  Whereto I have invited many a guest,
  Such as I love; and you, among the store,
  One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
  At my poor house look to behold this night
  Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.
  Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
  When well-apparell'd April on the heel
  Of limping winter treads, even such delight
  Among fresh female buds shall you this night
  Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,                           30
  And like her most whose merit most shall be;
  Which on more view of many, mine being one
  May stand in number, though in reckoning none.
  Come, go with me.--[_To Servant, giving a paper_] Go, sirrah, trudge
    about
  Through fair Verona; find those persons out
  Whose names are written there, and to them say,
  My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
                                       [_Exeunt Capulet and Paris._

  _Servant._ Find them out whose names are written
  here! It is written that the shoemaker should meddle
  with his yard and the tailor with his last, the                   40
  fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets;
  but I am sent to find those persons whose names are
  here writ, and can never find what names the writing
  person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In
  good time.

_Enter_ BENVOLIO _and_ ROMEO

  _Benvolio._ Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
  One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
  Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
  One desperate grief cures with another's languish.
  Take thou some new infection to thy eye,                          50
  And the rank poison of the old will die.

  _Romeo._ Your plantain-leaf is excellent for that.

  _Benvolio._ For what, I pray thee?

  _Romeo._                         For your broken shin.

  _Benvolio._ Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

  _Romeo._ Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;
  Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
  Whipp'd and tormented and--Good-den, good fellow.

  _Servant._ God gi' good-den.--I pray, sir, can you
  read?

  _Romeo._ Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.                       60

  _Servant._ Perhaps you have learned it without book;
  but, I pray, can you read any thing you see?

  _Romeo._ Ay, if I know the letters and the language.

  _Servant._ Ye say honestly; rest you merry!

  _Romeo._ Stay, fellow; I can read.

  [Reads] _'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
  County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the
  lady widow of Vitruvio; Signior Placentio and his
  lovely nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine;
  mine uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair               70
  niece Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his
  cousin Tybalt; Lucio and the lively Helena?'_
  A fair assembly; whither should they come?

  _Servant._ Up.

  _Romeo._ Whither?

  _Servant._ To supper; to our house.

  _Romeo._ Whose house?

  _Servant._ My master's.

  _Romeo._ Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.

  _Servant._ Now I'll tell you without asking. My                   80
  master is the great rich Capulet; and if you be not
  of the house of Montagues, I pray, come and crush
  a cup of wine. Rest you merry!                           [_Exit._

  _Benvolio._ At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
  Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st,
  With all the admired beauties of Verona.
  Go thither, and with unattainted eye
  Compare her face with some that I shall show,
  And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.

  _Romeo._ When the devout religion of mine eye                     90
  Maintains such falsehood then turn tears to fires;
  And these, who often drown'd could never die,
  Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
  One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
  Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.

  _Benvolio._ Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,
  Herself pois'd with herself in either eye;
  But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
  Your lady's love against some other maid
  That I will show you shining at this feast,                      100
  And she shall scant show well that now shows best.

  _Romeo._ I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
  But to rejoice in splendour of mine own.
                                                         [_Exeunt._


SCENE III. _A Room in Capulet's House_

_Enter_ LADY CAPULET _and_ Nurse

  _Lady Capulet._ Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.

  _Nurse._ Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,
  I bade her come.--What, lamb! what, lady-bird!--
  God forbid!--Where's this girl?--What, Juliet!

_Enter_ Juliet

  _Juliet._ How now! who calls?

  _Nurse._                      Your mother.

  _Juliet._                        Madam, I am here.
  What is your will?

  _Lady Capulet._ This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
  We must talk in secret.--Nurse, come back again;
  I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
  Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.                       10

  _Nurse._ Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.

  _Lady Capulet._ She's not fourteen.

  _Nurse._                         I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
  And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four,--
  She is not fourteen. How long is it now
  To Lammas-tide?

  _Lady Capulet._ A fortnight and odd days.

  _Nurse._ Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
  Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
  Were of an age; well, Susan is with God,
  She was too good for me; but, as I said,                          20
  On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
  That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
  'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
  And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
  Of all the days of the year, upon that day,
  For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
  Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
  My lord and you were then at Mantua,--
  Nay, I do bear a brain;--but, as I said,
  When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple                      30
  Of my dug, and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
  To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
  Shake, quoth the dove-house; 'twas no need, I trow,
  To bid me trudge.
  And since that time it is eleven years,
  For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
  She could have run and waddled all about.--
  God mark thee to his grace!
  Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd;
  An I might live to see thee married once,                         40
  I have my wish.

  _Lady Capulet._ Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
  I came to talk of.--Tell me, daughter Juliet,
  How stands your disposition to be married?

  _Juliet._ It is an honour that I dream not of.

  _Nurse._ An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
  I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.

  _Lady Capulet._ Well, think of marriage now; younger than you
  Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
  Are made already mothers. By my count,                            50
  I was your mother much upon these years
  That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
  The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

  _Nurse._ A man, young lady! lady, such a man
  As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.

  _Lady Capulet._ Verona's summer hath not such a flower.

  _Nurse._ Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.

  Lady Capulet. What say you? can you love the gentleman?
  This night you shall behold him at our feast;
  Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,                        60
  And find delight writ there with beauty's pen.
  Examine every married lineament
  And see how one another lends content;
  And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies
  Find written in the margent of his eyes.
  This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
  To beautify him, only lacks a cover;
  The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
  For fair without the fair within to hide.
  That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,                    70
  That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
  So shall you share all that he doth possess,
  By having him making yourself no less.
  Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?

  _Juliet._ I'll look to like, if looking liking move;
  But no more deep will I endart mine eye
  Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.

_Enter a_ Servant

  _Servant._ Madam, the guests are come, supper
  served up, you called, my young lady asked for,
  the nurse cursed in the pantry, and every thing in                80
  extremity. I must hence to wait; I beseech you,
  follow straight.

  _Lady Capulet._ We follow thee.--[_Exit Servant._] Juliet, the county
     stays.

  _Nurse._ Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.    [_Exeunt._


SCENE IV. _A Street_

_Enter_ ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, _with five or six_ Maskers,
Torch-bearers, _and others_

  _Romeo._ What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
  Or shall we on without apology?

  _Benvolio._ The date is out of such prolixity.
  We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
  Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
  Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
  Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
  After the prompter, for our entrance.
  But let them measure us by what they will,
  We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.                        10

  _Romeo._ Give me a torch; I am not for this ambling.
  Being but heavy, I will bear the light.

  _Mercutio._ Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.

  _Romeo._ Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes
  With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead
  So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.

  _Mercutio._ You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
  And soar with them above a common bound.

  _Romeo._ I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
  To soar with his light feathers, and, so bound,                   20
  I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe;
  Under love's heavy burden do I sink.

  _Mercutio._ And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
  Too great oppression for a tender thing.

  _Romeo._ Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
  Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.

  _Mercutio._ If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
  Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.--
  Give me a case to put my visage in; [_Putting on a mask_]
  A visor for a visor! what care I                                  30
  What curious eye doth quote deformities?
  Here are the beetle-brows shall blush for me.

  _Benvolio._ Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in
  But every man betake him to his legs.

  _Romeo._ A torch for me; let wantons light of heart
  Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
  For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase:
  I'll be a candle-holder and look on.
  The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.

  _Mercutio._ Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word;       40
  If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
  Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
  Up to the ears.--Come, we burn daylight, ho!

  _Romeo._ Nay, that's not so.

  _Mercutio._                      I mean, sir, in delay
  We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
  Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
  Five times in that ere once in our five wits.

  _Romeo._ And we mean well in going to this mask;
  But 'tis no wit to go.

  _Mercutio._                      Why, may one ask?

  _Romeo._ I dreamt a dream to-night.

  _Mercutio._                      And so did I.                    50

  _Romeo._ Well, what was yours?

  _Mercutio._                      That dreamers often lie.

  _Romeo._ In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.

  _Mercutio._ O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
  She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
  In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
  On the fore-finger of an alderman,
  Drawn with a team of little atomies
  Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
  Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners' legs,
  The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,                           60
  The traces of the smallest spider's web,
  The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
  Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
  Her waggoner a small grey-coated gnat,
  Not half so big as a round little worm
  Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
  Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
  Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
  Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
  And in this state she gallops night by night                      70
  Through lover's brains, and then they dream of love;
  O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight;
  O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
  O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
  Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
  Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.
  Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
  And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
  And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
  Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,                       80
  Then dreams he of another benefice.
  Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
  And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
  Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
  Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
  Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
  And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
  And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
  That plats the manes of horses in the night,
  And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,                   90
  Which once untangled much misfortune bodes.
  This is she--

  _Romeo._                         Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
  Thou talk'st of nothing.

  _Mercutio._              True, I talk of dreams,
  Which are the children of an idle brain,
  Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
  Which is as thin of substance as the air,
  And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
  Even now the frozen bosom of the North,
  And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
  Turning his face to the dew-dropping South.                      100

  _Benvolio._ This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves;
  Supper is done, and we shall come too late.

  _Romeo._ I fear, too early; for my mind misgives
  Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,
  Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
  With this night's revels, and expire the term
  Of a despised life clos'd in my breast
  By some vile forfeit of untimely death,
  But He that hath the steerage of my course
  Direct my sail!--On, lusty gentlemen.                            110

  _Benvolio._ Strike, drum.                              [_Exeunt._


SCENE V. _A Hall in Capulet's House_

Musicians _waiting_. _Enter_ Servingmen _with napkins_

1 _Servingman._ Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He shift
a trencher! he scrape a trencher!

2 _Servingman._ When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.

1 _Servingman._ Away with the joint-stools, remove the court-cupboard,
look to the plate.--Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane; and, as
thou lovest me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and          10
Nell.--Antony!--and Potpan!

2 _Servingman._ Ay, boy, ready.

1 _Servingman._ You are looked for and called for, asked for and sought
for, in the great chamber.

2 _Servingman._ We cannot be here and there too.--Cheerly, boys; be
brisk a while, and the longer liver take all.

_Enter_ CAPULET, _with_ JULIET _and others of his house_, _meeting the_
GUESTS _and_ Maskers

  _Capulet._ Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
  Unplagu'd with corns will have a bout with you.--
  Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all                            20
  Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
  She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?--
  Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
  That I have worn a visor and could tell
  A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
  Such as would please; 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone.--
  You are welcome, gentlemen!--Come, musicians, play.--
  A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.--
                                    [_Music plays, and they dance._

  More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
  And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.--                 30
  Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.--
  Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,
  For you and I are past our dancing days.
  How long is 't now since last yourself and I
  Were in a mask?

  _2 Capulet._                     By 'r lady, thirty years.

  _Capulet._ What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much!
  'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
  Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
  Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.

  _2 Capulet._ 'Tis more, 'tis more! His son is elder, sir;         40
  His son is thirty.

  _Capulet._                       Will you tell me that?
  His son was but a ward two years ago.

  _Romeo._ [_To a Servingman_] What lady is that, which doth enrich the
    hand
  Of yonder knight?

  _Servingman._ I know not, sir.

  _Romeo._ O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
  Her beauty hangs upon the cheek of night
  Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
  Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
  So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows                         50
  As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
  The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
  And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
  Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
  For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.

  _Tybalt._ This, by his voice, should be a Montague.--
  Fetch me my rapier, boy.--What dares the slave
  Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
  To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
  Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,                           60
  To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.

  _Capulet._ Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?

  _Tybalt._ Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
  A villain that is hither come in spite,
  To scorn at our solemnity this night.

  _Capulet._ Young Romeo is it?

  _Tybalt._                        'Tis he, that villain Romeo.

  _Capulet._ Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.
  He bears him like a portly gentleman;
  And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
  To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.                         70
  I would not for the wealth of all the town
  Here in my house do him disparagement;
  Therefore be patient, take no note of him.
  It is my will, the which if thou respect,
  Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
  An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.

  _Tybalt._ It fits when such a villain is a guest;
  I'll not endure him.

  _Capulet._                       He shall be endur'd;
  What, goodman boy! I say he shall. Go to;
  Am I the master here, or you? go to.                              80
  You'll not endure him!--God shall mend my soul!--
  You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
  You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!

  _Tybalt._ Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.

  _Capulet._                        Go to, go to;
  You are a saucy boy.--Is 't so, indeed?--
  This trick may chance to scathe you,--I know what.
  You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.--
  Well said, my hearts!--You are a princox; go!
  Be quiet, or--More light, more light!--For shame!
  I'll make you quiet. What!--Cheerly, my hearts!                   90

  _Tybalt._ Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
  Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
  I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall,
  Now seeming sweet, convert to bitter gall.                 [Exit.

  _Romeo._ [_To Juliet_] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
  This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
  My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
    To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.

  _Juliet._ Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
  Which mannerly devotion shows in this;                           100
  For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
  And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

  _Romeo._ Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

  _Juliet._ Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

  _Romeo._ O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
  They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

  _Juliet._ Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.

  _Romeo._ Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
  Thus from my lips by thine my sin is purg'd.      [_Kissing her._

  _Juliet._ Then have my lips the sin that they have took.

  _Romeo._ Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!
  Give me my sin again.

  _Juliet._                        You kiss by the book.           112

  _Nurse._ Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

  _Romeo._ What is her mother?

  _Nurse._                         Marry, bachelor,
  Her mother is the lady of the house,
  And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.
  I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal;
  I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
  Shall have the chinks.

  _Romeo._ Is she a Capulet?
  O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.                        120

  _Benvolio._ Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.

  _Romeo._ Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.

  _Capulet._ Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
  We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.--
  Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all;
  I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.--
  More torches here!--Come on then, let's to bed.
  Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late;
  I'll to my rest.              [_Exeunt all but Juliet and Nurse._

  _Juliet._ Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?

  _Nurse._ The son and heir of old Tiberio.                         131

  _Juliet._ What's he that now is going out of door?

  _Nurse._ Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.

  _Juliet._ What's he that follows there, that would not dance?

  _Nurse._ I know not.

  _Juliet._ Go, ask his name.--If he be married,
  My grave is like to be my wedding bed.

  _Nurse._ His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
  The only son of your great enemy.

  _Juliet._ My only love sprung from my only hate!                 140
  Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
  Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
  That I must love a loathed enemy.

  _Nurse._ What's this? what's this?

  _Juliet._                        A rhyme I learn'd even now
  Of one I danc'd withal.             [_One calls within_ 'Juliet.'

  _Nurse._                         Anon, anon!--
  Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.          [_Exeunt._

ACT II

_Enter_ Chorus

  Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
    And young affection gapes to be his heir;
  That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
    With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
  Now Romeo is belov'd and loves again,
    Alike bewitched by the charm of looks,
  But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,
    And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
  Being held a foe, he may not have access
    To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
  And she as much in love, her means much less
    To meet her new-beloved any where.
  But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
  Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.                [_Exit._


SCENE I. _A Lane by the Wall of Capulet's Orchard_

_Enter_ ROMEO

  _Romeo._ Can I go forward when my heart is here?--
  Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
                   [_He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it._

_Enter_ BENVOLIO _and_ MERCUTIO

  _Benvolio._ Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo!

  _Mercutio._                                He is wise,
  And, on my life, hath stolen him home to bed.

  _Benvolio._ He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall;
  Call, good Mercutio.

  _Mercutio._          Nay, I'll conjure too.--
  Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
  Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh!
  Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
  Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove';                 10
  Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
  One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
  Young Abraham Cupid, he that shot so trim
  When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar-maid!--
  He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
  The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.--
  I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
  By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
  That in thy likeness thou appear to us!

  _Benvolio._ An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.              20

  _Mercutio._ This cannot anger him; 'twould anger him
  To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
  Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
  Till she had laid it and conjur'd it down.
  That were some spite; my invocation
  Is fair and honest, and in his mistress' name
  I conjure only but to raise up him.

  _Benvolio._ Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
  To be consorted with the humorous night;
  Blind is his love and best befits the dark.                       30

  _Mercutio._ If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.--
  Romeo, good night.--I'll to my truckle-bed;
  This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
  Come, shall we go?

  _Benvolio._         Go, then; for 'tis in vain
  To seek him here that means not to be found.           [_Exeunt._

SCENE II. _Capulet's Orchard_

_Enter_ ROMEO

  _Romeo._ He jests at scars that never felt a wound.--
                               [_Juliet appears above at a window._
  But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
  It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.--
  Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
  Who is already sick and pale with grief
  That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
  Be not her maid, since she is envious.
  Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
  And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.--
  It is my lady, O, it is my love!                                  10
  O, that she knew she were!--
  She speaks, yet she says nothing; what of that?
  Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
  I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks.
  Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
  Having some business, do entreat her eyes
  To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
  What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
  The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
  As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven                       20
  Would through the airy region stream so bright
  That birds would sing and think it were not night.
  See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
  O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
  That I might touch that cheek!

  _Juliet._                        Ay me!

  _Romeo._                         She speaks.--
  O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
  As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,
  As is a winged messenger of heaven
  Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
  Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him,                         30
  When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
  And sails upon the bosom of the air.

  _Juliet._ O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
  Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
  Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love
  And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

  _Romeo._ [_Aside_] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?

  _Juliet._ 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
  Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
  What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
  Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
  Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
  What's in a name? That which we call a rose
  By any other name would smell as sweet;
  So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
  Retain that dear perfection which he owes
  Without that title.--Romeo, doff thy name,
  And for that name, which is no part of thee,
  Take all myself.

  _Romeo._                         I take thee at thy word.
  Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;
  Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

  _Juliet._ What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
  So stumblest on my counsel?

  _Romeo._                         By a name
  I know not how to tell thee who I am.
  My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
  Because it is an enemy to thee;
  Had I it written, I would tear the word.

  _Juliet._ My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
  Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.--
  Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?                                60

  _Romeo._ Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.

  _Juliet._ How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
  The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
  And the place death, considering who thou art,
  If any of my kinsmen find thee here.

  _Romeo._ With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls,
  For stony limits cannot hold love out,
  And what love can do that dares love attempt;
  Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.

  _Juliet._ If they do see thee, they will murther thee.            70

  _Romeo._ Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
  Than twenty of their swords; look thou but sweet,
  And I am proof against their enmity.

  _Juliet._ I would not for the world they saw thee here.

  _Romeo._ I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes;
  And but thou love me, let them find me here.
  My life were better ended by their hate
  Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.

  _Juliet._ By whose direction found'st thou out this place?

  _Romeo._ By love, that first did prompt me to inquire;
  He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.                          81
  I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
  As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
  I would adventure for such merchandise.

  _Juliet._ Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
  For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.
  Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
  What I have spoke; but farewell compliment!
  Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say ay,                       90
  And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,
  Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries,
  They say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
  If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully;
  Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
  I'll frown and be perverse and say thee nay,
  So thou wilt woo, but else not for the world.
  In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
  And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;
  But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true                    100
  Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
  I should have been more strange, I must confess,
  But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
  My true love's passion; therefore pardon me,
  And not impute this yielding to light love,
  Which the dark night hath so discovered.

  _Romeo._ Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
  That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--

  _Juliet._ O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
  That monthly changes in her circled orb,                         110
  Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

  _Romeo._ What shall I swear by?

  _Juliet._                        Do not swear at all;
  Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
  Which is the god of my idolatry,
  And I'll believe thee.

  _Romeo._                         If my heart's dear love--

  _Juliet._ Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
  I have no joy of this contract to-night;
  It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden,
  Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
  Ere one can say it lightens. Sweet, good night!                  120
  This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
  May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
  Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
  Come to thy heart as that within my breast!

  _Romeo._ O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

  _Juliet._ What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?

  _Romeo._ The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.

  _Juliet._ I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
  And yet I would it were to give again.

  _Romeo._ Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?        130

  _Juliet._ But to be frank and give it thee again;
  And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
  My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
  My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
  The more I have, for both are infinite.
                                             [_Nurse calls within._
  I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!--
  Anon, good nurse!--Sweet Montague, be true.
  Stay but a little, I will come again.                    [_Exit._

  _Romeo_. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,
  Being in night, all this is but a dream,                         140
  Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.

_Re-enter_ JULIET, _above_

  _Juliet._ Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
  If that thy bent of love be honourable,
  Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
  By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
  Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
  And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay,
  And follow thee my lord throughout the world.

  _Nurse._ [_Within_] Madam!

  _Juliet._ I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,           150
  I do beseech thee--

  _Nurse._ [_Within_] Madam!

  _Juliet._                        By and by, I come.--
  To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief;
  To-morrow will I send.

  _Romeo._                         So thrive my soul--

  _Juliet._ A thousand times good night!                   [_Exit_.

  _Romeo._ A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.--
  Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books,
  But love from love toward school with heavy looks.
                                                [_Retiring slowly._

_Re-enter_ JULIET, _above_

  _Juliet._ Hist! Romeo, hist!--O, for a falconer's voice,
  To lure this tassel-gentle back again!                           160
  Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;
  Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
  And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
  With repetition of my Romeo's name.

  _Romeo._ It is my soul that calls upon my name;
  How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
  Like softest music to attending ears!

  _Juliet._ Romeo!

  _Romeo._                         My dear?

  _Juliet._                        At what o'clock to-morrow
  Shall I send to thee?

  _Romeo._                         At the hour of nine.

  _Juliet._ I will not fail; 't is twenty years till then.         170
  I have forgot why I did call thee back.

  _Romeo._ Let me stand here till thou remember it.

  _Juliet._ I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
  Remembering how I love thy company.

  _Romeo._ And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
  Forgetting any other home but this.

  _Juliet._ 'T is almost morning; I would have thee gone,
  And yet no farther than a wanton's bird,
  Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
  Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,                       180
  And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
  So loving-jealous of his liberty.

  _Romeo._ I would I were thy bird.

  _Juliet._                         Sweet, so would I;
  Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
  Good night, good night! parting is such sweet sorrow
  That I shall say good night till it be morrow.     [_Exit above._

  _Romeo._ Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
  Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
  Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,                        189
  His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.               [_Exit._

SCENE III. _Friar Laurence's Cell_

_Enter_ FRIAR LAURENCE, _with a basket_

  _Friar Laurence._ The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
  Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
  And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
  From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels.
  Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
  The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
  I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
  With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
  The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
  What is her burying grave that is her womb,                       10
  And from her womb children of divers kind
  We sucking on her natural bosom find,
  Many for many virtues excellent,
  None but for some, and yet all different.
  O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
  In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities!
  For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
  But to the earth some special good doth give;
  Nor aught so good but, strain'd from that fair use,
  Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.                      20
  Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,
  And vice sometime's by action dignified.
  Within the infant rind of this weak flower
  Poison hath residence, and medicine power;
  For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part,
  Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
  Two such opposed kings encamp them still
  In man as well as herbs,--grace and rude will;
  And where the worser is predominant,
  Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.                    30

_Enter_ ROMEO

_Romeo._ Good morrow, father.

  _Friar Laurence._                Benedicite!
  What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?--
  Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
  So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.
  Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
  And where care lodges sleep will never lie;
  But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
  Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.
  Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
  Thou art up-rous'd with some distemperature;                      40
  Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
  Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.

  _Romeo._ That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.

  _Friar Laurence._ God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?

  _Romeo._ With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
  I have forgot that name and that name's woe.

  _Friar Laurence._ That's my good son; but where
  hast thou been, then?

  _Romeo._ I 'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
  I have been feasting with mine enemy,
  Where on a sudden one hath wounded me                             50
  That's by me wounded; both our remedies
  Within thy help and holy physic lies.
  I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
  My intercession likewise steads my foe.

  _Friar Laurence._ Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
  Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

  _Romeo._ Then plainly know, my heart's dear love is set
  On the fair daughter of rich Capulet.
  As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
  And all combin'd, save what thou must combine                     60
  By holy marriage. When and where and how
  We met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,
  I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
  That thou consent to marry us to-day.

  _Friar Laurence._ Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
  Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
  So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
  Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
  Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
  Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!                       70
  How much salt water thrown away in waste,
  To season love that of it doth not taste!
  The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
  Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
  Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
  Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet.
  If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
  Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline;
  And art thou chang'd? pronounce this sentence then:
  Women may fall when there's no strength in men.                   80

  _Romeo._ Thou chidd'st me oft for loving Rosaline.

  _Friar Laurence._ For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.

  _Romeo._ And bad'st me bury love.

  _Friar Laurence._                Not in a grave,
  To lay one in, another out to have.

  _Romeo._ I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
  Doth grace for grace and love for love allow,
  The other did not so.

  _Friar Laurence._                O, she knew well
  Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
  But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
  In one respect I'll thy assistant be;                             90
  For this alliance may so happy prove
  To turn your households' rancour to pure love.

  _Romeo._ O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste.

  _Friar Laurence._ Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
                                                         [_Exeunt._


SCENE IV. _A Street_

_Enter_ BENVOLIO _and_ MERCUTIO

  _Mercutio._ Where the devil should this Romeo be?
  Came he not home to-night?

  _Benvolio._ Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.

  _Mercutio._ Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,
  Torments him so that he will sure run mad.

  _Benvolio._ Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
  Hath sent a letter to his father's house.

  _Mercutio._ A challenge, on my life.

  _Benvolio._ Romeo will answer it.

  _Mercutio._ Any man that can write may answer                     10
  a letter.

  _Benvolio._ Nay, he will answer the letter's master,
  how he dares, being dared.

  _Mercutio._ Alas, poor Romeo! he is already dead;
  stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot thorough
  the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his
  heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft; and
  is he a man to encounter Tybalt?

  _Benvolio._ Why, what is Tybalt?

  _Mercutio._ More than prince of cats, I can tell you.             20
  O, he is the courageous captain of compliments! He
  fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance,
  and proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two,
  and the third in your bosom; the very butcher of a
  silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
  very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah,
  the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the hay!

  _Benvolio._ The what?

  _Mercutio._ The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
  fantasticoes, these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,              30
  a very good blade! a very tall man!'--Why, is not
  this a lamentable thing, grandsire, that we should be
  thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers,
  these _pardonnez-mois_, who stand so much
  on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the
  old bench? O, their _bons_, their _bons!_

_Enter_ ROMEO

  _Benvolio._ Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.

  _Mercutio._ Without his roe, like a dried herring. O
  flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified! Now is he for the
  numbers that Petrarch flowed in; Laura to his lady                40
  was but a kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better
  love to be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra
  a gypsy; Helen and Hero hildings and harlots;
  Thisbe a grey eye or so, but not to the purpose.--Signior
  Romeo, _bon jour_! there's a French salutation
  to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
  fairly last night.

  _Romeo._ Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit
  did I give you?

  _Mercutio._ The slip, sir, the slip; can you not                  50
  conceive?

  _Romeo._ Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was
  great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain
  courtesy.

  _Mercutio._ That's as much as to say, such a case
  as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.

  _Romeo._ Meaning, to curtsy.

  _Mercutio._ Thou hast most kindly hit it.

  _Romeo._ A most courteous exposition.

  _Mercutio._ Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.                  60

  _Romeo._ Pink for flower.

  _Mercutio._ Right.

  _Romeo._ Why, then is my pump well flowered.

  _Mercutio._ Well said; follow me this jest now till
  thou hast worn out thy pump, that when the single
  sole of it is worn the jest may remain after the wearing
  sole singular.

  _Romeo._ O single-souled jest, solely singular for
  the singleness!

  _Mercutio._ Come between us, good Benvolio; my                    70
  wits fail.

  _Romeo._ Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or
  I'll cry a match.

  _Mercutio._ Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase,
  I have done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in
  one of thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole
  five. Was I with you there for the goose?

  _Romeo._ Thou wast never with me for any thing
  when thou was not there for the goose.

  _Mercutio._ I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.            80

  _Romeo._ Nay, good goose, bite not.

  _Mercutio._ Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is
  a most sharp sauce.

  _Romeo._ And is it not well served in to a sweet
  goose?

  _Mercutio._ O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches
  from an inch narrow to an ell broad!

  _Romeo._ I stretch it out for that word 'broad,'
  which added to the goose proves thee far and wide
  a broad goose.                                                    90

  _Mercutio._ Why, is not this better now than groaning
  for love? Now art thou sociable, now art thou
  Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well
  as by nature; for this drivelling love is like a great
  natural,--

  _Benvolio._ Stop there, stop there.

  _Romeo._ Here's goodly gear!

_Enter_ NURSE _and_ PETER

  _Mercutio._ A sail, a sail!

  _Benvolio._ Two, two; a shirt and a smock.

  _Nurse._ Peter!                                                  100

  _Peter._ Anon!

  _Nurse._ My fan, Peter.

  _Mercutio._ Good Peter, to hide her face; for her
  fan's the fairer of the two.

  _Nurse._ God ye good morrow, gentlemen.

  _Mercutio._ God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.

  _Nurse._ Is it good den?

  _Mercutio._ 'Tis no less, I tell you, for the hand of
  the dial is now upon the prick of noon.

  _Nurse._ Out upon you! what a man are you!                       110

  _Romeo._ One, gentlewoman, that God hath made
  for himself to mar.

  _Nurse._ By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself
  to mar,' quoth a'?--Gentlemen, can any of you tell
  me where I may find the young Romeo?

  _Romeo._ I can tell you; but young Romeo will be
  older when you have found him than he was when
  you sought him. I am the youngest of that name,
  for fault of a worse.

  _Nurse._ You say well.                                           120

  _Mercutio._ Yea, is the worst well? very well took,
  i' faith; wisely, wisely.

  _Nurse._ If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence
  with you.

  _Benvolio._ She will indite him to some supper.

  _Mercutio._ So ho!

  _Romeo._ What hast thou found?

  _Mercutio._ No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a
  lenten pie, that is something stale and hoar ere it be
  spent.--Romeo, will you come to your father's?                   130
  we'll to dinner thither.

  _Romeo._ I will follow you.

  _Mercutio._ Farewell, ancient lady; farewell, [_singing_]
  'lady, lady, lady!'              [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._

  _Nurse._ Marry, farewell!--I pray you, sir, what
  saucy merchant was this, that was so full of his
  ropery?

  _Romeo._ A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear
  himself talk, and will speak more in a minute than
  he will stand to in a month.                                     140

  _Nurse._ An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take
  him down an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty
  such Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that
  shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I
  am none of his skains-mates.--And thou must stand
  by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his
  pleasure?

  _Peter._ I saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I
  had, my weapon should quickly have been out, I
  warrant you. I dare draw as soon as another man,                 150
  if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on
  my side.

  _Nurse._ Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every
  part about me quivers. Scurvy knave!--Pray you,
  sir, a word: and as I told you, my young lady bade
  me inquire you out; what she bade me say, I will
  keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should
  lead her in a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a
  very gross kind of behaviour, as they say; for the
  gentlewoman is young, and, therefore, if you should              160
  deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing to be
  offered to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.

  _Romeo._ Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress.
  I protest unto thee--

  _Nurse._ Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as
  much. Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman!

  _Romeo._ What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost
  not mark me.

  _Nurse._ I will tell her, sir, that you do protest,
  which, as I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.                   170

  _Romeo._ Bid her devise some means to come to shrift
  This afternoon;
  And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
  Be shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.

  _Nurse._ No, truly, sir, not a penny.

  _Romeo._ Go to; I say you shall.

  _Nurse._ This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.

  _Romeo._ And stay, good nurse; behind the abbey wall
  Within this hour my man shall be with thee,
  And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,                  180
  Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
  Must be my convoy in the secret night.
  Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.
  Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.

  _Nurse._ Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.

  _Romeo._ What say'st thou, my dear nurse?

  _Nurse._ Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
  Two may keep counsel, putting one away?

  _Romeo._ I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.

  _Nurse._ Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,      190
  Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing--O,
  there is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would
  fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as
  lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger
  her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer
  man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
  as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
  rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?

  _Romeo._ Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.

  _Nurse._ Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name; R is                 200
  for the--No, I know it begins with some other
  letter--and she hath the prettiest sententious of it,
  of you and rosemary, that it would do you good to
  hear it.

  _Romeo._ Commend me to thy lady.

  _Nurse._ Ay, a thousand times.--[_Exit Romeo_] Peter!

  _Peter._ Anon.

  _Nurse._ Before, and apace.                            [_Exeunt._


SCENE V. _Capulet's Orchard_

_Enter_ JULIET

  _Juliet._ The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
  In half an hour she promis'd to return.
  Perchance she cannot meet him; that's not so.
  O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
  Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams
  Driving back shadows over lowering hills;
  Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love,
  And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
  Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
  Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve                  10
  Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
  Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
  She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
  My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
  And his to me;
  But old folks, many feign as they were dead,
  Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.--

_Enter_ NURSE _and_ PETER

  O God, she comes!--O honey nurse, what news?
  Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.

  _Nurse._ Peter, stay at the gate.                  [_Exit Peter._

  _Juliet._ Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?   21
  Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
  If good, thou sham'st the music of sweet news
  By playing it to me with so sour a face.

  _Nurse._ I am aweary, give me leave awhile.
  Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!

  _Juliet._ I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.
  Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.

  _Nurse._ Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
  Do you not see that I am out of breath?                           30

  _Juliet._ How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
  To say to me that thou art out of breath?
  The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
  Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
  Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
  Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance.
  Let me be satisfied, is 't good or bad?

  _Nurse._ Well, you have made a simple choice; you
  know not how to choose a man. Romeo! no, not
  he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his             40
  leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and
  a body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they
  are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy,
  but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
  ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at
  home?

  _Juliet._ No, no; but all this did I know before.
  What says he of our marriage? what of that?

  _Nurse._ Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
  It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.                       50
  My back o' t'other side,--O, my back, my back!
  Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
  To catch my death with jaunting up and down!

  _Juliet._ I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
  Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?

  _Nurse._ Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
  And a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome,
  And, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?

  _Juliet._ Where is my mother! why, she is within;
  Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!                     60
  'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
  Where is your mother?'

  _Nurse._                         O God's lady dear!
  Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
  Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
  Henceforward do your messages yourself.

  _Juliet._ Here's such a coil!--come, what says Romeo?

  _Nurse._ Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?

  _Juliet._ I have.

  _Nurse._ Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
  There stays a husband to make you a wife.                         70
  Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
  They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
  Hie you to church; I must another way,
  To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
  Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.
  I am the drudge, and toil in your delight.
  Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.

  _Juliet._ Hie to high fortune!--Honest nurse, farewell.
                                                          [_Exeunt._


SCENE VI. _Friar Laurence's Cell_

_Enter_ FRIAR LAURENCE _and_ ROMEO

  _Friar Laurence._ So smile the heavens upon this holy act
  That after hours with sorrow chide us not!

  _Romeo._ Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
  It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
  That one short minute gives me in her sight.
  Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
  Then love--devouring death do what he dare,
  It is enough I may but call her mine.

  _Friar Laurence._ These violent delights have violent ends,
  And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,                   10
  Which as they kiss consume; the sweetest honey
  Is loathsome in his own deliciousness,
  And in the taste confounds the appetite.
  Therefore love moderately, long love doth so;
  Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.--

_Enter_ JULIET

  Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot
  Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint!
  A lover may bestride the gossamer
  That idles in the wanton summer air,
  And yet not fall, so light is vanity.                             20

  _Juliet._ Good even to my ghostly confessor.

  _Friar Laurence._ Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.

  _Juliet._ As much to him, else is his thanks too much.

  _Romeo._ Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
  Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
  To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
  This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
  Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both
  Receive in either by this dear encounter.

  _Juliet._ Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
  Brags of his substance, not of ornament.                          31
  They are but beggars that can count their worth;
  But my true love is grown to such excess
  I cannot sum up half my sum of wealth.

  _Friar Laurence._ Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
  For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
  Till holy church incorporate two in one.               [_Exeunt._

[Illustration: Loggia of Capulet's House]




ACT III

SCENE I. _A Public Place_


_Enter_ MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, _and_ Servants

  _Benvolio._ I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.
  The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
  And if we meet we shall not scape a brawl;
  For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.

  _Mercutio._ Thou art like one of those fellows that
  when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his
  sword upon the table, and says 'God send me no
  need of thee!' and by the operation of the second
  cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is
  no need.                                                          10

  _Benvolio._ Am I like such a fellow?

  _Mercutio._ Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in
  thy mood as any in Italy, and as soon moved to be
  moody, and as soon moody to be moved.

  _Benvolio._ And what to?

  _Mercutio._ Nay, an there were two such, we should
  have none shortly, for one would kill the other.
  Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath
  a hair more, or a hair less, in his beard than thou
  hast. Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking                   20
  nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast
  hazel eyes; what eye but such an eye would spy out
  such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels as
  an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been
  beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou
  hast quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street,
  because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain
  asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a
  tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter?
  with another for tying his new shoes with old riband?             30
  and yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling!

  _Benvolio._ An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art,
  any man should buy the fee-simple of my life for an
  hour and a quarter.

  _Mercutio._ The fee-simple! O simple!

  _Benvolio._ By my head, here come the Capulets.

  _Mercutio._ By my heel, I care not.

_Enter_ TYBALT _and others_

  _Tybalt._ Follow me close, for I will speak to them.--
  Gentlemen, good den; a word with one of you.

  _Mercutio._ And but one word with one of us?                      40
  couple it with something; make it a word and a
  blow.

  _Tybalt._ You shall find me apt enough to that, sir,
  an you will give me occasion.

  _Mercutio._ Could you not take some occasion without
  giving?

  _Tybalt._ Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--

  _Mercutio._ Consort! what, dost thou make us
  minstrels? an thou make minstrels of us, look to
  hear nothing but discords; here's my fiddlestick,                 50
  here's that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!

  _Benvolio._ We talk here in the public haunt of men.
  Either withdraw unto some private place,
  Or reason coldly of your grievances,
  Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.

  _Mercutio._ Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
  I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.

_Enter_ ROMEO

  _Tybalt._ Well, peace be with you, sir; here comes my man.

  _Mercutio._ But I'll be hang'd, sir, if he wear your livery.
  Marry, go before to field, he 'll be your follower;               60
  Your worship in that sense may call him man.

  _Tybalt._ Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
  No better term than this,--thou art a villain.

  _Romeo._ Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
  Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
  To such a greeting. Villain am I none,
  Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.

  _Tybalt._ Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
  That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.

  _Romeo._ I do protest, I never injur'd thee,                      70
  But love thee better than thou canst devise
  Till thou shalt know the reason of my love;
  And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
  As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.

  _Mercutio._ O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
  A la stoccata carries it away.--                        [_Draws._
  Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?

  _Tybalt._ What wouldst thou have with me?

  _Mercutio._ Good king of cats, nothing but one of
  your nine lives; that I mean to make bold withal,                 80
  and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest
  of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his
  pilcher by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about
  your ears ere it be out.

  _Tybalt._ I am for you.                               [_Drawing._

  _Romeo._ Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.

  _Mercutio._ Come, sir, your passado.               [_They fight._

  _Romeo._ Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.--
  Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
  Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath                       90
  Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.
  Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
                                [_Exeunt Tybalt and his partisans._

  _Mercutio._                      I am hurt.
  A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
  Is he gone, and hath nothing?

  _Benvolio._                      What, art thou hurt?

  Mercutio. Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.--
  Where is my page?--Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.    [_Exit Page._

  _Romeo._ Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.

  _Mercutio._ No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so
  wide as a church-door, but 'tis enough, 'twill serve;
  ask for me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave              100
  man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world.--A
  plague o' both your houses!--Zounds, a dog, a rat,
  a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart,
  a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
  arithmetic!--Why the devil came you between us?
  I was hurt under your arm.

  _Romeo._ I thought all for the best.

  _Mercutio._ Help me into some house, Benvolio,
  Or I shall faint.--A plague o' both your houses!
  They have made worms' meat of me. I have it,                     110
  And soundly too;--your houses!
                                    [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio_

  _Romeo._ This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
  My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
  In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
  With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
  Hath been my cousin!--O sweet Juliet,
  Thy beauty hath made me effeminate,
  And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!

_Re-enter_ BENVOLIO

  _Benvolio._ O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
  That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds,                     120
  Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.

  _Romeo._ This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
  This but begins the woe others must end.

  _Benvolio._ Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.

_Re-enter_ TYBALT

  _Romeo._ Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
  Away to heaven, respective lenity,
  And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!--
  Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again
  That late thou gav'st me! for Mercutio's soul
  Is but a little way above our heads,                             130
  Staying for thine to keep him company;
  Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.

  _Tybalt._ Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
  Shalt with him hence.

  _Romeo._                         This shall determine that.
                                       [_They fight; Tybalt falls._

  _Benvolio._ Romeo, away, be gone!
  The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
  Stand not amaz'd; the prince will doom thee death
  If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!

  _Romeo._ O, I am fortune's fool!

  _Benvolio._                      Why dost thou stay?
                                                     [_Exit Romeo._

_Enter_ Citizens, _etc_.

  _1 Citizen._ Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?              140
  Tybalt, that murtherer, which way ran he?

  _Benvolio._ There lies that Tybalt.

  _1 Citizen._                     Up, sir, go with me;
  I charge thee in the prince's name, obey.

_Enter_ Prince, _attended_; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, _their_ Wives, _and
others_

  _Prince._ Where are the vile beginners of this fray?

  _Benvolio._ O noble prince, I can discover all
  The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.
  There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
  That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.

  _Lady Capulet._ Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
  O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt               150
  Of my dear kinsman!--Prince, as thou art true,
  For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.--
  O cousin, cousin!

  _Prince._ Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

  _Benvolio._ Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
  Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
  How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal
  Your high displeasure. All this, uttered
  With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
  Could not take truce with the unruly spleen                      160
  Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
  With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
  Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
  And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
  Cold death aside, and with the other sends
  It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
  Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,
  'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue,
  His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
  And 'twixt them rushes, underneath whose arm                     170
  An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
  Of stout Mercutio; and then Tybalt fled,
  But by and by comes back to Romeo,
  Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
  And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
  Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain,
  And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
  This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.

  _Lady Capulet._ He is a kinsman to the Montague;
  Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.                   180
  Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
  And all those twenty could but kill one life.
  I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
  Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.

  _Prince._ Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
  Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?

  _Montague._ Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
  His fault concludes but what the law should end,
  The life of Tybalt.

  _Prince._ And for that offence
  Immediately we do exile him hence.                               190
  I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
  My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
  But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
  That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
  I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
  Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.
  Therefore use none; let Romeo hence in haste,
  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
  Bear hence this body and attend our will;
  Mercy but murthers, pardoning those that kill.                   200
                                                         [_Exeunt._


SCENE II. _Capulet's Orchard_

_Enter_ JULIET

  _Juliet._ Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
  Towards Phœbus' lodging; such a waggoner
  As Phaethon would whip you to the west
  And bring in cloudy night immediately.--
  Spread thy close curtain, love-performing Night,
  That runaways' eyes may wink, and Romeo
  Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.--
  Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
  By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
  It best agrees with night.--Come, civil Night,                    10
  Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
  And learn me how to lose a winning match,
  Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
  Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
  With thy black mantle, till strange love grown bold
  Think true love acted simple modesty.
  Come, Night, come, Romeo, come, thou day in night,
  For thou wilt lie upon the wings of Night
  Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
  Come, gentle Night, come, loving, black-brow'd Night,
  Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,                         21
  Take him and cut him out in little stars,
  And he will make the face of heaven so fine
  That all the world will be in love with night
  And pay no worship to the garish sun.--
  O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
  But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
  Not yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this day
  As is the night before some festival
  To an impatient child that hath new robes                         30
  And may not wear them.--O, here comes my nurse,
  And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
  But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.--

_Enter_ Nurse, _with cords_

  Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
  That Romeo bid thee fetch?

  _Nurse._                         Ay, ay, the Cords.
                                               [_Throws them down._

  _Juliet._ Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?

  _Nurse._ Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
  We are undone, lady, we are undone!
  Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!

  _Juliet._ Can heaven be so envious?

  _Nurse._                            Romeo can,                    40
  Though heaven cannot.--O Romeo, Romeo!--
  Who ever would have thought it?--Romeo!

  _Juliet._ What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
  This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
  Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but ay,
  And that bare vowel I shall poison more
  Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
  I am not I, if there be such an I,
  Or those eyes shut that make thee answer ay.
  If he be slain, say ay; or if not, no.                            50
  Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.

  _Nurse._ I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes--
  God save the mark!--here on his manly breast;
  A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse,
  Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
  All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.

  _Juliet._ O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
  To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,
  And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!                          60

  _Nurse._ O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
  O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
  That ever I should live to see thee dead!

  _Juliet._ What storm is this that blows so contrary?
  Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
  My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?
  Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
  For who is living if those two are gone?

  _Nurse._ Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
  Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.                            70

  _Juliet._ O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?

  _Nurse._ It did, it did; alas the day, it did!

  _Juliet._ O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face;
  Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
  Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
  Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
  Despised substance of divinest show!
  Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
  A damned saint, an honourable villain!
  O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,                          80
  When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
  In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
  Was ever book containing such vile matter
  So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
  In such a gorgeous palace!

  _Nurse._                         There's no trust,
  No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd,
  All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.--
  Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitæ.--
  These griefs, these woes, these sorrows, make me old.
  Shame come to Romeo!

  _Juliet._                        Blister'd be thy tongue          90
  For such a wish! he was not born to shame;
  Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit,
  For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
  Sole monarch of the universal earth.
  O, what a beast was I to chide at him!

  _Nurse._ Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?

  _Juliet._ Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?--
  Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name
  When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
  But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?              100
  That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband.
  Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
  Your tributary drops belong to woe,
  Which you mistaking offer up to joy.
  My husband lives that Tybalt would have slain,
  And Tybalt's dead that would have slain my husband.
  All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
  Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
  That murther'd me. I would forget it fain,
  But, O, it presses to my memory,                                 110
  Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
  'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished!'
  That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
  Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
  Was woe enough, if it had ended there;
  Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
  And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
  Why follow'd not, when she said Tybalt's dead,
  Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
  Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?                       120
  But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,
  'Romeo is banished!'--to speak that word,
  Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
  All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
  There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
  In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.--
  Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?

  _Nurse._ Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.
  Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.

  _Juliet._ Wash they his wounds with tears; mine shall be spent,  130
  When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
  Take up those cords.--Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,
  Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd;
  He made you for a highway to my bed,
  But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.

  _Nurse._ Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo
  To comfort you; I wot well where he is.
  Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.
  I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.

  _Juliet._ O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
  And bid him come to take his last farewell.                       141
                                                         [_Exeunt._


SCENE III. _Friar Laurence's Cell_

_Enter_ FRIAR LAURENCE

  _Friar Laurence._ Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.
  Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
  And thou art wedded to calamity.

_Enter_ ROMEO

  _Romeo._ Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
  What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
  That I yet know not?

  _Friar Laurence._ Too familiar
  Is my dear son with such sour company;
  I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.

  _Romeo._ What less than doomsday is the prince's doom?

  _Friar Laurence._ A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,      10
  Not body's death, but body's banishment.

  _Romeo._ Ha, banishment! be merciful, say death,
  For exile hath more terror in his look,
  Much more than death; do not say banishment.

  _Friar Laurence._ Hence from Verona art thou banished;
  Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.

  _Romeo._ There is no world without Verona walls,
  But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
  Hence banished is banish'd from the world,
  And world's exile is death. Then banished                         20
  Is death misterm'd; calling death banishment
  Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
  And smil'st upon the stroke that murthers me.

  _Friar Laurence._ O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
  Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
  Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
  And turn'd that black word death to banishment.
  This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.

  _Romeo._ 'Tis torture, and not mercy; heaven is here,
  Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog                         30
  And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
  Live here in heaven and may look on her,
  But Romeo may not. More validity,
  More honourable state, more courtship lives
  In carrion-flies than Romeo. They may seize
  On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
  And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
  Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,
  Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
  But Romeo may not, he is banished.                                40
  This may flies do, when I from this must fly;
  They are free men, but I am banished.
  And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
  Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
  No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
  But 'banished' to kill me?--Banished!
  O friar, the damned use that word in hell,
  Howling attends it; how hast thou the heart,
  Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
  A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,                          50
  To mangle me with that word 'banished'?

  _Friar Laurence._ Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.

  _Romeo._ O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.

  _Friar Laurence._ I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;
  Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
  To comfort thee, though thou art banished.

  _Romeo._ Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
  Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
  Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
  It helps not, it prevails not; talk no more.                      60

  _Friar Laurence._ O, then I see that madmen have no ears.

  _Romeo._ How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?

  _Friar Laurence._ Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.

  _Romeo._ Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.
  Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
  An hour but married, Tybalt murthered,
  Doting like me and like me banished,
  Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
  And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
  Taking the measure of an unmade grave.                            70
                                                [_Knocking within._

  _Friar Laurence._ Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.

  _Romeo._ Not I; unless the breath of heart-sick groans
  Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.          [_Knocking._

  _Friar Laurence._ Hark, how they knock!--Who's there?--Romeo, arise;
  Thou wilt be taken.--Stay awhile!--Stand up;          [_Knocking._
  Run to my study.--By and by!--God's will,
  What simpleness is this!--I come, I come!             [_Knocking._
  Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?

  _Nurse._ [_Within_] Let me come in and you shall know my errand;
  I come from Lady Juliet.

  _Friar Laurence._        Welcome, then.                           80

_Enter_ NURSE

  _Nurse._ O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
  Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?

  _Friar Laurence._ There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.

  _Nurse._ O, he is even in my mistress' case,
  Just in her case!

  _Friar Laurence._ O woful sympathy!
  Piteous predicament!

  _Nurse._                         Even so lies she,
  Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.--
  Stand up, stand up; stand, an you be a man.
  For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand.
  Why should you fall into so deep an O?                            90

  _Romeo._ Nurse!

  _Nurse._ Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.

  _Romeo._ Spak'st thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
  Doth she not think me an old murtherer,
  Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
  With blood remov'd but little from her own?
  Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
  My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?

  _Nurse._ O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
  And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,                    100
  And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
  And then down falls again.

  _Romeo._                         As if that name,
  Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
  Did murther her, as that name's cursed hand
  Murther'd her kinsman.--O, tell me, friar, tell me,
  In what vile part of this anatomy
  Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
  The hateful mansion.                        [_Drawing his sword._

  _Friar Laurence._    Hold thy desperate hand!
  Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art;
  Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote                     110
  The unreasonable fury of a beast.
  Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
  Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
  Thou hast amaz'd me; by my holy order,
  I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
  Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
  And slay thy lady too that lives in thee,
  By doing damned hate upon thyself?
  Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
  Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet              120
  In thee at once, which thou at once wouldst lose.
  Fie, fie, thou sham'st thy shape, thy love, thy wit,
  Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
  And usest none in that true use indeed
  Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.
  Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
  Digressing from the valour of a man;
  Thy dear love sworn, but hollow perjury,
  Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
  Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,                        130
  Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
  Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,
  Is set a-fire by thine own ignorance,
  And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
  What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
  For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
  There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,
  But thou slew'st Tybalt; there art thou happy too.
  The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
  And turns it to exile; there art thou happy.                     140
  A pack of blessings lights upon thy back,
  Happiness courts thee in her best array;
  But, like a misbehav'd and sullen wench,
  Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.
  Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
  Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
  Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her;
  But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
  For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,
  Where thou shalt live till we can find a time                    150
  To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
  Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
  With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
  Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.--
  Go before, nurse, commend me to thy lady,
  And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
  Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto;
  Romeo is coming.

  _Nurse._ O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
  To hear good counsel; O, what learning is!--                     160
  My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.

  _Romeo._ Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.

  _Nurse._ Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir;
  Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.             [_Exit._

  _Romeo._ How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!

  _Friar Laurence._ Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
  Either be gone before the watch be set,
  Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence.
  Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
  And he shall signify from time to time                           170
  Every good hap to you that chances here.
  Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.

  _Romeo._ But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
  It were a grief, so brief to part with thee.
  Farewell.                                              [_Exeunt._


SCENE IV. _A Room in Capulet's House_

_Enter_ CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, _and_ PARIS

  _Capulet._ Things have fallen out, sir, so unluckily
  That we have had no time to move our daughter.
  Look you, she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
  And so did I.--Well, we were born to die.--
  'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night;
  I promise you, but for your company,
  I would have been a-bed an hour ago.

  _Paris._ These times of woe afford no time to woo.--
  Madam, good night; commend me to your daughter.

  _Lady Capulet._ I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;        10
  To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.

  _Capulet._ Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
  Of my child's love. I think she will be rul'd
  In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.--
  Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
  Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love,
  And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
  But, soft! what day is this?

  _Paris._                         Monday, my lord.

  _Capulet._ Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.
  O' Thursday let it be; o' Thursday, tell her,                     20
  She shall be married to this noble earl.
  Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
  We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
  For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
  It may be thought we held him carelessly,
  Being our kinsman, if we revel much.
  Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
  And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?

  _Paris._ My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.

  _Capulet._ Well, get you gone; o' Thursday be it then.--          30
  Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
  Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.--
  Farewell, my lord.--Light to my chamber, ho!
  Afore me, it is so very late, that we
  May call it early by and by.--Good night.              [_Exeunt._


SCENE V. _Juliet's Chamber_

_Enter_ ROMEO _and_ JULIET

  _Juliet._ Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day.
  It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
  That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear;
  Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree.
  Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.

  _Romeo._ It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
  No nightingale; look, love, what envious streaks
  Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.
  Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
  Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.                        10
  I must be gone and live, or stay and die.

  _Juliet._ Yon light is not daylight, I know it, I.
  It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
  To be to thee this night a torch-bearer
  And light thee on thy way to Mantua;
  Therefore stay yet, thou need'st not to be gone.

  _Romeo._ Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
  I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
  I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
  'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;                       20
  Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
  The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
  I have more care to stay than will to go;
  Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
  How is 't, my soul? let's talk, it is not day.

  _Juliet._ It is, it is; hie hence, be gone, away!
  It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
  Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
  Some say the lark makes sweet division;
  This doth not so, for she divideth us.                            30
  Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes;
  O, now I would they had chang'd voices too!
  Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
  Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day.
  O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.

  _Romeo._ More light and light?--More dark and
  dark our woes!

_Enter_ Nurse

  _Nurse._ Madam!

  _Juliet._ Nurse?

  _Nurse._ Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.
  The day is broke; be wary, look about.                   [_Exit._

  _Juliet._ Then, window, let day in, and let life out.             41

  _Romeo._ Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
                                                 [_Romeo descends._

  _Juliet._ Art thou gone so? my lord, my love, my friend!
  I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
  For in a minute there are many days.
  O, by this count I shall be much in years
  Ere I again behold my Romeo!

  _Romeo._ Farewell! I will omit no opportunity
  That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.

  _Juliet._ O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?              50

  _Romeo._ I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
  For sweet discourses in our time to come.

  _Juliet._ O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
  Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
  As one dead in the bottom of a tomb;
  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.

  _Romeo._ And trust me, love, in my eye so do you;
  Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!               [_Exit._

  _Juliet._ O Fortune, Fortune! all men call thee fickle;
  If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him                      60
  That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, Fortune;
  For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
  But send him back.

  _Lady Capulet._ [_Within_] Ho, daughter! are you up?

  _Juliet._ Who is 't that calls? is it my lady mother?
  Is she not down so late, or up so early?
  What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?

_Enter_ LADY CAPULET

  _Lady Capulet._ Why, how now, Juliet!

  _Juliet._                        Madam, I am not well.

  _Lady Capulet._ Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
  An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;               70
  Therefore, have done. Some grief shows much of love,
  But much of grief shows still some want of wit.

  _Juliet._ Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.

  _Lady Capulet._ So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
  Which you weep for.

  _Juliet._                        Feeling so the loss,
  I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.

  _Lady Capulet._ Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death
  As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.

  _Juliet._ What villain, madam?

  _Lady Capulet._                  That same villain, Romeo.

  _Juliet._ Villain and he be many miles asunder.--                 80
  God pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
  And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.

  _Lady Capulet._ That is, because the traitor murtherer lives.

  _Juliet._ Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.
  Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!

  _Lady Capulet._ We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not;
  Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
  Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
  Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram
  That he shall soon keep Tybalt company;                           90
  And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.

  _Juliet._ Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
  With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
  Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd.--
  Madam, if you could find out but a man
  To bear a poison, I would temper it,
  That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
  Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
  To hear him nam'd, and cannot come to him,
  To wreak the love I bore my cousin                               100
  Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!

  _Lady Capulet._ Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
  But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.

  _Juliet._ And joy comes well in such a needy time.
  What are they, I beseech your ladyship?

  _Lady Capulet._ Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
  One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
  Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
  That thou expect'st not, nor I look'd not for.

  _Juliet._ Madam, in happy time, what day is that?                110

  _Lady Capulet._ Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
  The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,
  The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
  Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.

  _Juliet._ Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
  He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
  I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
  Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
  I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
  I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,                   120
  It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
  Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!

  _Lady Capulet._ Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
  And see how he will take it at your hands.

_Enter_ CAPULET _and_ Nurse

  _Capulet._ When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
  But for the sunset of my brother's son
  It rains downright.--
  How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
  Evermore showering? In one little body
  Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind:                       130
  For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
  Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
  Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs,
  Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
  Without a sudden calm, will overset
  Thy tempest-tossed body.--How now, wife!
  Have you deliver'd to her our decree?

  _Lady Capulet._ Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
  I would the fool were married to her grave!

  _Capulet._ Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.       140
  How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
  Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
  Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
  So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?

  _Juliet._ Not proud you have, but thankful that you have;
  Proud can I never be of what I hate,
  But thankful even for hate that is meant love.

  _Capulet._ How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
  'Proud' and 'I thank you' and 'I thank you not,'
  And yet 'not proud'! Mistress minion, you,                       150
  Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
  But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
  To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
  Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
  Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
  You tallow-face!

  _Lady Capulet._ Fie, fie! what, are you mad?

  _Juliet._ Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
  Hear me with patience but to speak a word.

  _Capulet._ Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
  I tell thee what, get thee to church o' Thursday                 160
  Or never after look me in the face.
  Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
  My fingers itch.--Wife, we scarce thought us blest
  That God had lent us but this only child,
  But now I see this one is one too much,
  And that we have a curse in having her;
  Out on her, hilding!

  _Nurse._                         God in heaven bless her!
  You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.

  _Capulet._ And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
  Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.                    170

  _Nurse._ I speak no treason.

  _Capulet._                        O, God ye god-den!

  _Nurse._ May not one speak?

  _Capulet._                       Peace, you mumbling fool!
  Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,
  For here we need it not.

  _Lady Capulet._                  You are too hot.

  _Capulet._ God's bread! it makes me mad! Day, night, late, early,
  At home, abroad, alone, in company,
  Waking, or sleeping, still my care hath been
  To have her match'd; and having now provided
  A gentleman of noble parentage,
  Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,                   180
  Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
  Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man,--
  And then to have a wretched puling fool,
  A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
  To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
  I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'--
  But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you;
  Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.
  Look to 't, think on 't, I do not use to jest.
  Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise.                     190
  An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
  An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,
  For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
  Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
  Trust to 't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.          [_Exit._

  _Juliet._ Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
  That sees into the bottom of my grief?
  O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
  Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
  Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed                           200
  In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.

  _Lady Capulet._ Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word;
  Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.              [_Exit._

  _Juliet._ O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
  My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
  How shall that faith return again to earth,
  Unless that husband send it me from heaven
  By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.--
  Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
  Upon so soft a subject as myself!--                              210
  What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
  Some comfort, nurse.

  _Nurse._                         Faith, here 'tis. Romeo
  Is banished, and all the world to nothing
  That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
  Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
  Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
  I think it best you married with the county.
  O, he's a lovely gentleman!
  Romeo's a dishclout to him; an eagle, madam,
  Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye                      220
  As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
  I think you are happy in this second match,
  For it excels your first; or if it did not,
  Your first is dead, or 'twere as good he were
  As living here and you no use of him.

  _Juliet._ Speakest thou from thy heart?

  _Nurse._                         And from my soul too;
  Or else beshrew them both.

  _Juliet._                        Amen!

  _Nurse._                         What?

  _Juliet._ Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
  Go in, and tell my lady I am gone,
  Having displeas'd my father, to Laurence' cell,                  230
  To make confession and to be absolv'd.

  _Nurse._ Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.         [_Exit._

  _Juliet._ Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
  Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
  Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
  Which she hath prais'd him with above compare
  So many thousand times?--Go, counsellor;
  Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.--
  I'll to the friar, to know his remedy;
  If all else fail, myself have power to die.              [_Exit._

[Illustration: JULIET AT LAURENCE'S CELL.]




ACT IV

SCENE I. _Friar Laurence's Cell_


_Enter_ FRIAR LAURENCE _and_ PARIS

  _Friar Laurence._ On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.

  _Paris._ My father Capulet will have it so,
  And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.

  _Friar Laurence._ You say you do not know the lady's mind;
  Uneven is the course, I like it not.

  _Paris._ Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
  And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
  For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
  Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
  That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,                       10
  And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
  To stop the inundation of her tears,
  Which, too much minded by herself alone,
  May be put from her by society.
  Now do you know the reason of this haste.

  _Friar Laurence._ [_Aside_] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.--
  Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.

_Enter_ JULIET

  _Paris._ Happily met, my lady and my wife!

  _Juliet._ That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.

  _Paris._ That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.             20

  _Juliet._ What must be shall be.

  _Friar Laurence._                That's a certain text.

  _Paris._ Come you to make confession to this father?

  _Juliet._ To answer that, I should confess to you.

  _Paris._ Do not deny to him that you love me.

  _Juliet._ I will confess to you that I love him.

  _Paris._ So will you, I am sure, that you love me.

  _Juliet._ If I do so, it will be of more price,
  Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.

_Paris._ Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.

  _Juliet._ The tears have got small victory by that,               30
  For it was bad enough before their spite.

  _Paris._ Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.

  _Juliet._ That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
  And what I spake, I spake it to my face.

  _Paris._ Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.

  _Juliet._ It may be so, for it is not mine own.--
  Are you at leisure, holy father, now,
  Or shall I come to you at evening mass?

  _Friar Laurence._ My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.--
  My lord, we must entreat the time alone.                          40

  _Paris._ God shield I should disturb devotion!--
  Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye;
  Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.               [_Exit._

  _Juliet._ O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
  Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!

  _Friar Laurence._ Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
  It strains me past the compass of my wits.
  I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
  On Thursday next be married to this county.

  _Juliet._ Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,          50
  Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it;
  If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,
  Do thou but call my resolution wise,
  And with this knife I'll help it presently.
  God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
  And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
  Shall be the label to another deed,
  Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
  Turn to another, this shall slay them both.
  Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,                      60
  Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
  'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
  Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
  Which the commission of thy years and art
  Could to no issue of true honour bring.
  Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
  If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.

  _Friar Laurence._ Hold, daughter! I do spy a kind of hope,
  Which craves as desperate an execution
  As that is desperate which we would prevent.                      70
  If, rather than to marry County Paris,
  Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
  Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
  A thing like death to chide away this shame
  That cop'st with death himself to scape from it;
  And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.

  _Juliet._ O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
  From off the battlements of yonder tower;
  Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
  Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;                  80
  Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
  O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
  With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
  Or bid me go into a new-made grave
  And hide me with a dead man in his shroud,--
  Things, that to hear them told, have made me tremble,--
  And I will do it without fear or doubt,
  To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.

  _Friar Laurence._ Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
  To marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.                           90
  To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
  Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.
  Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
  And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
  When presently through all thy veins shall run
  A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
  Shall keep his native progress but surcease.
  No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
  The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
  To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,                           100
  Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
  Each part, depriv'd of supple government,
  Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;
  And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
  Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
  And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
  Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
  To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.
  Then, as the manner of our country is,
  In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier                          110
  Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
  Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
  In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
  Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
  And hither shall he come; and he and I
  Will watch thy waking, and that very night
  Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
  And this shall free thee from this present shame,
  If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
  Abate thy valour in the acting it.                               120

  _Juliet._ Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!

  _Friar Laurence._ Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
  In this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed
  To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.

  _Juliet._ Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
  Farewell, dear father!                                 [_Exeunt._


SCENE II. _Hall in Capulet's House_

_Enter_ CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, Nurse, _and two_ Servingmen

  _Capulet._ So many guests invite as here are writ.--
                                                   [_Exit Servant._
  Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.

  _2 Servant._ You shall have none ill, sir, for I'll
  try if they can lick their fingers.

  _Capulet._ How canst thou try them so?

  _2 Servant._ Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot
  lick his own fingers; therefore he that cannot lick his
  fingers goes not with me.

  _Capulet._ Go, be gone.--                        [_Exit Servant._
  We shall be much unfurnish'd for this time.                       10
  What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?

  _Nurse._ Ay, forsooth.

  _Capulet._ Well, he may chance to do some good on her;
  A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.

  _Nurse._ See where she comes from shrift with merry look.

_Enter_ JULIET

  _Capulet._ How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?

  _Juliet._ Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
  Of disobedient opposition
  To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
  By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here                           20
  And beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you!
  Henceforward I am ever rul'd by you.

  _Capulet._ Send for the county; go tell him of this.
  I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.

  _Juliet._ I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell,
  And gave him what becomed love I might,
  Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.

  _Capulet._ Why, I am glad on 't; this is well,--stand up.
  This is as 't should be.--Let me see the county;
  Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.--                     30
  Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
  All our whole city is much bound to him.

  _Juliet._ Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
  To help me sort such needful ornaments
  As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?

  _Lady Capulet._ No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.

  _Capulet._ Go, nurse, go with her; we'll to church to-morrow.
                                        [_Exeunt Juliet and Nurse._

  _Lady Capulet._ We shall be short in our provision;
  'Tis now near night.

  _Capulet._                       Tush, I will stir about,
  And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.               40
  Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.
  I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone,
  I'll play the housewife for this once.--What, ho!--
  They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
  To County Paris, to prepare him up
  Against to-morrow. My heart is wondrous light,
  Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.          [_Exeunt._

Scene III. _Juliet's Chamber_

_Enter_ JULIET _and_ Nurse

  _Juliet._ Ay, those attires are best; but, gentle nurse,
  I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night,
  For I have need of many orisons
  To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
  Which, well thou know'st, is cross and full of sin.

_Enter_ LADY CAPULET

  _Lady Capulet._ What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?

  _Juliet._ No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
  As are behoveful for our state to-morrow.
  So please you, let me now be left alone,
  And let the nurse this night sit up with you;                     10
  For, I am sure, you have your hands full all
  In this so sudden business.

  _Lady Capulet._             Good night;
  Get thee to bed and rest, for thou hast need.
                                  [_Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse._

  _Juliet._ Farewell!--God knows when we shall meet again.
  I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
  That almost freezes up the heat of life;
  I'll call them back again to comfort me.--
  Nurse!--What should she do here?
  My dismal scene I needs must act alone.--
  Come, vial.--                                                     20
  What if this mixture do not work at all?
  Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
  No, no!--this shall forbid it.--Lie thou there.--
                                           [_Laying down a dagger._

  What if it be a poison, which the friar
  Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
  Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd
  Because he married me before to Romeo?
  I fear it is; and yet, methinks, it should not,
  For he hath still been tried a holy man.
  How if, when I am laid into the tomb,                             30
  I wake before the time that Romeo
  Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
  Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
  To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
  And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
  Or, if I live, is it not very like,
  The horrible conceit of death and night,
  Together with the terror of the place,--
  As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
  Where for these many hundred years the bones                      40
  Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd;
  Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
  Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
  At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
  Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
  So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
  And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
  That living mortals hearing them run mad;--
  O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
  Environed with all these hideous fears?                           50
  And madly play with my forefathers' joints?
  And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
  And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
  As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?--
  O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
  Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
  Upon a rapier's point.--Stay, Tybalt, stay!--
  Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
                                  [_She throws herself on the bed._


SCENE IV. _Hall in Capulet's House_

_Enter_ LADY CAPULET _and_ Nurse

  _Lady Capulet._ Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, nurse.

  _Nurse._ They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.

_Enter_ CAPULET

  _Capulet._ Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
  The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock.--
  Look to the bak'd meats, good Angelica;
  Spare not for cost.

  _Nurse._                         Go, you cot-quean, go,
  Get you to bed; faith, you'll be sick to-morrow
  For this night's watching.

  _Capulet._ No, not a whit. What! I have watch' ere now
  All night for lesser cause and ne'er been sick.                   10

  _Lady Capulet._ Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time,
  But I will watch you from such watching now.
                                  [_Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse._

  _Capulet._ A jealous-hood, a jealous-hood!--

_Enter three or four_ Servingmen, _with spits, logs, and baskets_

                                   Now, fellow,
  What's there?

  _1 Servant._ Things for the cook, sir, but I know not what.

  _Capulet._ Make haste, make haste.--[_Exit Servant._]
    Sirrah, fetch drier logs;
  Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.

  _2 Servant._ I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,
  And never trouble Peter for the matter.                  [_Exit._

  _Capulet._ Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
  Thou shalt be logger-head.--Good faith, 'tis day;                 21
  The county will be here with music straight,
  For so he said he would. I hear him near.--      [_Music within._

  Nurse!--Wife!--What, ho!--What, nurse, I say!

  _Re-enter_ Nurse

  Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;
  I'll go and chat with Paris.--Hie, make haste,
  Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already;
  Make haste, I say.                                     [_Exeunt._


SCENE V. _Juliet's Chamber_

_Enter_ Nurse

  _Nurse._ Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she.--
  Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
  Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
  What, not a word?--How sound is she asleep!
  I needs must wake her.--Madam, madam, madam!
  Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
  He'll fright you up, i' faith.--Will it not be?
                                           [_Undraws the curtains._

  What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
  I must needs wake you. Lady! lady! lady!--
  Alas, alas!--Help, help! my lady's dead!--                        10
  O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!--
  Some aqua vitæ, ho!--My lord! my lady!

_Enter_ LADY CAPULET

  _Lady Capulet._ What noise is here?

  _Nurse._                         O lamentable day!

  _Lady Capulet._ What is the matter?

  _Nurse._                         Look, look! O heavy day!

  _Lady Capulet._ O me, O me! My child, my only life,
  Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!--
  Help, help! Call help.

_Enter_ CAPULET

  _Capulet._ For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.

  _Nurse._ She's dead, deceas'd, she's dead; alack the day!

  _Lady Capulet._ Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!  20

  _Capulet._ Ha! let me see her. Out, alas! she's cold;
  Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
  Life and these lips have long been separated.
  Death lies on her like an untimely frost
  Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.

  _Nurse._ O lamentable day!

  _Lady Capulet._                  O woful time!

  _Capulet._ Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
  Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.

_Enter_ FRIAR LAURENCE _and_ PARIS _with_ Musicians

  _Friar Laurence._ Come, is the bride ready to go to church?

  _Capulet._ Ready to go, but never to return.--                    30
  O son! the night before thy wedding-day
  Hath Death lain with thy wife. See, there she lies,
  Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
  Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
  My daughter he hath wedded. I will die,
  And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.

  _Paris._ Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
  And doth it give me such a sight as this?

  _Lady Capulet._ Accurst, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
  Most miserable hour that e'er time saw                            40
  In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
  But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
  But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
  And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!

  _Nurse._ O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
  Most lamentable day, most woful day,
  That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
  O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
  Never was seen so black a day as this!
  O woful day, O woful day!                                         50

  _Paris._ Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
  Most detestable Death, by thee beguil'd,
  By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
  O love! O life! not life, but love in death!

  _Capulet._ Despis'd, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
  Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now
  To murther, murther our solemnity?--
  O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
  Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
  And with my child my joys are buried.                             60

  _Friar Laurence._ Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
  In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
  Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
  And all the better is it for the maid.
  Your part in her you could not keep from death,
  But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
  The most you sought was her promotion,
  For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd;
  And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc'd
  Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?                       70
  O, in this love you love your child so ill
  That you run mad seeing that she is well;
  She's not well married that lives married long,
  But she's best married that dies married young.
  Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
  On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,
  In all her best array bear her to church;
  For though fond nature bids us all lament,
  Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.

  _Capulet._ All things that we ordained festival                   80
  Turn from their office to black funeral:
  Our instruments to melancholy bells,
  Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
  Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
  Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
  And all things change them to the contrary.

  _Friar Laurence._ Sir, go you in,--and, madam, go with him;--
  And go, Sir Paris;--every one prepare
  To follow this fair corse unto her grave.
  The heavens do lower upon you for some ill;                       90
  Move them no more by crossing their high will.
                 [_Exeunt Capulet, Lady Capulet, Paris, and Friar._

  _1 Musician._ Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.

  _Nurse._ Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up;
  For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.              [_Exit._

  _1 Musician._ Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.

_Enter_ PETER

  _Peter._ Musicians, O musicians, 'Heart's ease,
  Heart's ease'; O, an you will have me live, play
  'Heart's ease.'

  _1 Musician._ Why 'Heart's ease'?

  _Peter._ O, musicians, because my heart itself plays             100
  'My heart is full of woe.' O, play me some merry
  dump, to comfort me.

  _1 Musician._ Not a dump we; 'tis no time to
  play now.

  _Peter._ You will not, then?

  _1 Musician._ No.

  _Peter._ I will then give it you soundly.

  _1 Musician._ What will you give us?

  _Peter._ No money, on my faith, but the gleek; I will give you the
  minstrel.                                                        110

  _1 Musician._ Then will I give you the
  serving-creature.

  _Peter._ Then will I lay the serving-creature's
  dagger on your pate. I will carry no crotchets; I'll
  re you, I'll fa you; do you note me?

  _1 Musician._ An you re us and fa us, you note
  us.

  _2 Musician._ Pray you, put up your dagger, and
  put out your wit.

  _Peter._ Then have at you with my wit! I will                    120
  drybeat you with an iron wit, and put up my iron
  dagger. Answer me like men:

    'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
      And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
    Then music with her silver sound'--

  why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
  sound'?--What say you, Simon Catling?

  _1 Musician._ Marry, sir, because silver hath a
  sweet sound.

  _Peter._ Pretty!--What say you, Hugh Rebeck?                     130

  _2 Musician._ I say 'silver sound,' because musicians
  sound for silver.

  _Peter._ Pretty too!--What say you, James Soundpost?

  _3 Musician._ Faith, I know not what to say.

  _Peter._ O, I cry you mercy, you are the singer; I
  will say for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
  because musicians have no gold for sounding.

    'Then music with her silver sound
      With speedy help doth lend redress.'                 [_Exit._

  _1 Musician._ What a pestilent knave is this same!               141

  _2 Musician._ Hang him, Jack!--Come, we'll in
  here, tarry for the mourners, and stay dinner.         [_Exeunt._

ACT V


SCENE I. _Mantua. A Street_

_Enter_ ROMEO

  _Romeo._ If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep
  My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
  My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne,
  And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
  Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
  I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
  Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think!--
  And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips
  That I reviv'd and was an emperor.
  Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,                      10
  When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!--

_Enter_ BALTHASAR

  News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
  Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
  How doth my lady? Is my father well?
  How fares my Juliet? that I ask again,
  For nothing can be ill if she be well.

  _Balthasar._ Then she is well, and nothing can be ill;
  Her body sleeps in Capel's monument
  And her immortal part with angels lives.
  I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault                       20
  And presently took post to tell it you.
  O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
  Since you did leave it for my office, sir.

  _Romeo._ Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!--
  Thou know'st my lodging; get me ink and paper,
  And hire post-horses. I will hence to-night.

  _Balthasar._ I do beseech you, sir, have patience;
  Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
  Some misadventure.

  _Romeo._                         Tush, thou art deceiv'd;
  Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do.                        30
  Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?

  _Balthasar._ No, my good lord.

  _Romeo._                         No matter; get thee gone
  And hire those horses. I'll be with thee straight.--
                                                 [_Exit Balthasar._
  Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
  Let's see for means.--O mischief, thou art swift
  To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
  I do remember an apothecary,--
  And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
  In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
  Culling of simples. Meagre were his looks,                      40
  Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;
  And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
  An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
  Of ill-shap'd fishes; and about his shelves
  A beggarly account of empty boxes,
  Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
  Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
  Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
  Noting this penury, to myself I said,
  An if a man did need a poison now,                              50
  Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
  Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.
  O, this same thought did but forerun my need,
  And this same needy man must sell it me!
  As I remember, this should be the house.
  Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.--
  What, ho! apothecary!

_Enter_ Apothecary

  _Apothecary._                    Who calls so loud?

  _Romeo._ Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.
  Hold, there is forty ducats; let me have
  A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear                       60
  As will disperse itself through all the veins
  That the life-weary taker may fall dead,
  And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath
  As violently as hasty powder fir'd
  Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.

  _Apothecary._ Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
  Is death to any he that utters them.

  _Romeo._ Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
  And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
  Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,                     70
  Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back,
  The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law;
  The world affords no law to make thee rich;
  Then be not poor, but break it and take this.

  _Apothecary._ My poverty, but not my will, consents.

  _Romeo._ I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.

  _Apothecary._ Put this in any liquid thing you will,
  And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
  Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.

  _Romeo._ There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,        80
  Doing more murthers in this loathsome world
  Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
  I sell thee poison, thou hast sold me none.
  Farewell; buy food, and get thyself in flesh.--
  Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
  To Juliet's grave, for there must I use thee.          [_Exeunt._


SCENE II. _Friar Laurence's Cell_

_Enter_ FRIAR JOHN

  _Friar John._ Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!

_Enter_ FRIAR LAURENCE

  _Friar Laurence._ This same should be the voice of Friar John.--
  Welcome from Mantua; what says Romeo?
  Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.

  _Friar John._ Going to find a barefoot brother out,
  One of our order, to associate me,
  Here in this city visiting the sick,
  And finding him, the searchers of the town,
  Suspecting that we both were in a house
  Where the infectious pestilence did reign,                      10
  Seal'd up the doors and would not let us forth,
  So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.

  _Friar Laurence._ Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?

  _Friar John._ I could not send it,--here it is again,--
  Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
  So fearful were they of infection.

  _Friar Laurence._ Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
  The letter was not nice, but full of charge
  Of dear import, and the neglecting it
  May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;                       20
  Get me an iron crow and bring it straight
  Unto my cell.

  _Friar John._ Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.        [_Exit._

  _Friar Laurence._ Now must I to the monument alone;
  Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.
  She will beshrew me much that Romeo
  Hath had no notice of these accidents;
  But I will write again to Mantua,
  And keep her at my cell till Romeo come.
  Poor living corse, clos'd in a dead man's tomb!          [_Exit._


SCENE III. _A Churchyard; in it a Tomb belonging to the Capulets_

_Enter_ PARIS, _and his_ Page _bearing flowers and a torch_

  _Paris._ Give me thy torch, boy; hence, and stand aloof;
  Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
  Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
  Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
  So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
  Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
  But thou shalt hear it; whistle then to me
  As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
  Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.

  _Page._ [_Aside_] I am almost afraid to stand alone             10
  Here in the churchyard, yet I will adventure.         [_Retires._

  _Paris._ Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew.
    O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones,
  Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
    Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans;
  The obsequies that I for thee will keep
  Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.--
                                              [_The Page whistles._

  The boy gives warning something doth approach.
  What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
  To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?                     20
  What, with a torch!--muffle me, night, awhile.
                                                        [_Retires._

_Enter_ ROMEO _and_ BALTHASAR, _with a torch, mattock, etc_.

  _Romeo._ Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
  Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
  See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
  Give me the light. Upon thy life, I charge thee,
  Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof
  And do not interrupt me in my course.
  Why I descend into this bed of death
  Is partly to behold my lady's face,
  But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger                 30
  A precious ring, a ring that I must use
  In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone;
  But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
  In what I further shall intend to do,
  By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
  And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
  The time and my intents are savage-wild,
  More fierce and more inexorable far
  Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.

  _Balthasar._ I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.          40

  _Romeo._ So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.
  Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.

  _Balthasar._ [_Aside_] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout;
  His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.            [_Retires._

  _Romeo._ Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
  Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth,
  Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
  And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
                                                   [_Opens the tomb._

  _Paris._ This is that banish'd haughty Montague
  That murther'd my love's cousin,--with which grief,             50
  It is supposed, the fair creature died,--
  And here is come to do some villanous shame
  To the dead bodies; I will apprehend him.--
                                                       [_Advances._
  Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
  Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
  Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.
  Obey, and go with me, for thou must die.

  _Romeo._ I must indeed, and therefore came I hither.
  Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man.
  Fly hence, and leave me; think upon these gone,                 60
  Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
  Put not another sin upon my head,
  By urging me to fury; O, be gone!
  By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
  For I come hither arm'd against myself.
  Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say
  A madman's mercy bade thee run away.

  _Paris._ I do defy thy conjurations
  And apprehend thee for a felon here.                            69

  _Romeo._ Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
                                                       [They fight.

  _Page._ O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.    [_Exit._

  _Paris._ O, I am slain!--[_Falls._] If thou be merciful,
  Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.                       [_Dies._

  _Romeo._ In faith, I will.--Let me peruse this face.
  Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
  What said my man when my betossed soul
  Did not attend him as we rode? I think
  He told me Paris should have married Juliet;
  Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
  Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,                        80
  To think it was so?--O, give me thy hand,
  One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
  I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave,--
  A grave? O, no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth;
  For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
  This vault a feasting presence full of light.
  Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.--
                                       [_Laying Paris in the tomb._
  How oft when men are at the point of death
  Have they been merry! which their keepers call
  A lightning before death; O, how may I                          90
  Call this a lightning?--O my love! my wife!
  Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
  Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
  Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
  Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
  And death's pale flag is not advanced there.--
  Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
  O, what more favour can I do to thee
  Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
  To sunder his that was thine enemy?                            100
  Forgive me, cousin!--Ah, dear Juliet,
  Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
  That unsubstantial Death is amorous,
  And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
  Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
  For fear of that, I still will stay with thee,
  And never from this palace of dim night
  Depart again. Here, here will I remain
  With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
  Will I set up my everlasting rest,                             110
  And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
  From this world-wearied flesh.--Eyes, look your last!
  Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
  The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
  A dateless bargain to engrossing death!--
  Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
  Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
  The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
  Here's to my love! [_Drinks._]--O true apothecary!             119
  Thy drugs are quick.--Thus with a kiss I die.            [_Dies._

_Enter_, _at the other end of the churchyard_, FRIAR LAURENCE, _with a
lantern_, _crow_, _and spade_

  _Friar Laurence._ Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
  Have my old feet stumbled at graves!--Who's there?

  _Balthasar._ Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.

  _Friar Laurence._ Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
  What torch is yond that vainly lends his light
  To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
  It burneth in the Capels' monument.

  _Balthasar._ It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
  One that you love.

  _Friar Laurence._ Who is it?

  _Balthasar._                     Romeo.                       129

  _Friar Laurence._ How long hath he been there?

  _Balthasar._                     Full half an hour.

  _Friar Laurence._ Go with me to the vault.

  _Balthasar._                     I dare not, sir;
  My master knows not but I am gone hence,
  And fearfully did menace me with death
  If I did stay to look on his intents.

  _Friar Laurence._ Stay, then; I 'll go alone.--Fear comes upon me;
  O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing!

  _Balthasar._ As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
  I dreamt my master and another fought,
  And that my master slew him.                             [_Exit._

  _Friar Laurence._                Romeo!--            [_Advances._
  Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains                140
  The stony entrance of this sepulchre?--
  What mean these masterless and gory swords
  To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?--
                                                [_Enters the tomb._
  Romeo! O, pale!--Who else? what, Paris too?
  And steep'd in blood?--Ah, what an unkind hour
  Is guilty of this lamentable chance!--
  The lady stirs.                                  [_Juliet wakes._

  _Juliet._ O comfortable friar! where is my lord?--
  I do remember well where I should be,
  And there I am.--Where is my Romeo?                            150
                                                   [_Noise within._

  _Friar Laurence._ I hear some noise.--Lady, come from that nest
  Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep;
  A greater power than we can contradict
  Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
  Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead,
  And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
  Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
  Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
  Come, go, good Juliet. [_Noise again._]--I dare no longer stay.

  _Juliet._ Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.             160
                                            [_Exit Friar Laurence._

  What's here? a cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?
  Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.--
  O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
  To help me after?--I will kiss thy lips;
  Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
  To make me die with a restorative.                 [_Kisses him._
  Thy lips are warm.

  _1 Watch._ [_Within_] Lead, boy; which way?

  _Juliet._ Yea, noise? then I'll be brief.--O happy dagger!
                                       [_Snatching Romeo's dagger._

  This is thy sheath [_Stabs herself_]; there rest, and let me die.
                                [_Falls on Romeo's body, and dies._

_Enter_ Watch, _with the_ Page _of_ PARIS

  _Page._ This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.   171

  _1 Watch._ The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard.
  Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.--       [_Exeunt some._
  Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain;
  And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
  Who here hath lain these two days buried.--
  Go, tell the prince;--run to the Capulets;--
  Raise up the Montagues;--some others search.--
                                          [_Exeunt other Watchmen._
  We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
  But the true ground of all these piteous woes                  180
  We cannot without circumstance descry.

_Re-enter some of the_ Watch, _with_ BALTHASAR

  _2 Watch._ Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.

  _1 Watch._ Hold him in safety till the prince come hither.

_Re-enter others of the_ Watch, _with_ FRIAR LAURENCE

  _3 Watch._ Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs, and weeps.
  We took this mattock and this spade from him,
  As he was coming from this churchyard side.

  _1 Watch._ A great suspicion; stay the friar too.

_Enter the_ PRINCE _and_ Attendants

  _Prince._ What misadventure is so early up
  That calls our person from our morning's rest?

_Enter_ CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, _and others_

  _Capulet._ What should it be that they so shriek abroad?       190

  _Lady Capulet._ The people in the street cry Romeo,
  Some Juliet, and some Paris, and all run
  With open outcry toward our monument.

  _Prince._ What fear is this which startles in our ears?

  _1 Watch._ Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
  And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
  Warm and new kill'd.

  _Prince._ Search, seek, and know how this foul murther comes.

  _1 Watch._ Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,
  With instruments upon them fit to open                         200
  These dead men's tombs.

  _Capulet._ O heaven!--O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
  This dagger hath mista'en,--for, lo, his house
  Is empty on the back of Montague,--
  And is mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!

  _Lady Capulet._ O me! this sight of death is as a bell
  That warns my old age to a sepulchre.

_Enter_ MONTAGUE _and others_

  _Prince._ Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
  To see thy son and heir more early down.

  _Montague._ Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;          210
  Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.
  What further woe conspires against mine age?

  _Prince._ Look, and thou shalt see.

  _Montague._ O thou untaught! what manners is in this,
  To press before thy father to a grave?

  _Prince._ Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
  Till we can clear these ambiguities,
  And know their spring, their head, their true descent;
  And then will I be general of your woes
  And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,                  220
  And let mischance be slave to patience.--
  Bring forth the parties of suspicion.

  _Friar Laurence._ I am the greatest, able to do least,
  Yet most suspected, as the time and place
  Doth make against me, of this direful murther;
  And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
  Myself condemned and myself excus'd.

  _Prince._ Then say at once what thou dost know in this.

  _Friar Laurence._ I will be brief, for my short date of breath
  Is not so long as is a tedious tale.                           230
  Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
  And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.
  I married them; and their stolen marriage-day
  Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death
  Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city,
  For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.
  You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
  Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
  To County Paris; then comes she to me,
  And with wild looks bid me devise some means                   240
  To rid her from this second marriage,
  Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
  Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
  A sleeping potion, which so took effect
  As I intended, for it wrought on her
  The form of death; meantime I writ to Romeo
  That he should hither come as this dire night,
  To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
  Being the time the potion's force should cease.
  But he which bore my letter, Friar John,                       250
  Was stay'd by accident and yesternight
  Return'd my letter back. Then all alone,
  At the prefixed hour of her waking,
  Came I to take her from her kindred's vault,
  Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
  Till I conveniently could send to Romeo;
  But when I came, some minute ere the time
  Of her awaking, here untimely lay
  The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
  She wakes, and I entreated her come forth                      260
  And bear this work of heaven with patience;
  But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
  And she too desperate would not go with me,
  But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
  All this I know, and to the marriage
  Her nurse is privy; and, if aught in this
  Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
  Be sacrific'd some hour before his time
  Unto the rigour of severest law.

  _Prince._ We still have known thee for a holy man.--
  Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?                   271

  _Balthasar._ I brought my master news of Juliet's death,
  And then in post he came from Mantua
  To this same place, to this same monument.
  This letter he early bid me give his father,
  And threaten'd me with death, going in the vault,
  If I departed not and left him there.

  _Prince._ Give me the letter; I will look on it.--
  Where is the county's page that rais'd the watch?--
  Sirrah, what made your master in this place?                   280

  _Page._ He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave
  And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
  Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,
  And by and by my master drew on him;
  And then I ran away to call the watch.

  _Prince._ This letter doth make good the friar's words,
  Their course of love, the tidings of her death;
  And here he writes that he did buy a poison
  Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal
  Came to this vault to die and lie with Juliet.--               290
  Where be these enemies?--Capulet!--Montague!
  See, what a scourge is aid upon your hate,
  That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
  And I, for winking at your discords too,
  Have lost a brace of kinsmen; all are punish'd.

  _Capulet._ O brother Montague, give me thy hand;
  This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
  Can I demand.

  _Montague._      But I can give thee more;
  For I will raise her statue in pure gold,
  That while Verona by that name is known                        300
  There shall no figure at such rate be set
  As that of true and faithful Juliet.

  _Capulet._ As rich shall Romeo by his lady lie,
  Poor sacrifices of our enmity!

  Prince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
  The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
  Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
  Some shall be pardon'd and some punished;
  For never was a story of more woe                              309
  Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.                     [_Exeunt._

THE TEMPEST.




ACT I.


SCENE I. _On a ship at sea: a tempestuous noise of thunder
and lightning heard._

  _Enter _a Ship-Master_ and _a Boatswain_._

_Mast._ Boatswain!

_Boats._ Here, master: what cheer?

_Mast._ Good, speak to the mariners: fall to’t, yarely, or
we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.    [_Exit._

  _Enter _Mariners_._

_Boats._ Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!              5
yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the master’s
whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind, if room enough!

  _Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND, GONZALO,
  and others._

_Alon._ Good boatswain, have care. Where’s the master?
Play the men.

_Boats._ I pray now, keep below.                                    10

_Ant._ Where is the master, boatswain?

_Boats._ Do you not hear him? You mar our labour:
keep your cabins: you do assist the storm.

_Gon._ Nay, good, be patient.

_Boats._ When the sea is. Hence! What cares these                   15
roarers for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble
us not.

_Gon._ Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.

_Boats._ None that I more love than myself. You are a
Counsellor; if you can command these elements to silence,           20
and work the peace of the present, we will not hand a rope
more; use your authority: if you cannot, give thanks you
have lived so long, and make yourself ready in your cabin
for the mischance of the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good
hearts! Out of our way, I say.    [_Exit._                          25

_Gon._ I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks
he hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is
perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging:
make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our own doth
little advantage. If he be not born to be hanged, our case          30
is miserable.    [_Exeunt._

  _Re-enter Boatswain._

_Boats._ Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower!
Bring her to try with main-course. [_A cry within._] A
plague upon this howling! they are louder than the weather
or our office.                                                      35

  _Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO._

Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o’er, and
drown? Have you a mind to sink?

_Seb._ A pox o’ your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,
incharitable dog!

_Boats._ Work you, then.                                            40

_Ant._ Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noise-maker.
We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.

_Gon._ I’ll warrant him for drowning; though the ship
were no stronger than a nutshell, and as leaky as an unstanched
wench.                                                              45

_Boats._ Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off
to sea again; lay her off.

  _Enter _Mariners_ wet._

_Mariners._ All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!

_Boats._ What, must our mouths be cold?

_Gon._ The king and prince at prayers! let’s assist them,           50
For our case is as theirs.

_Seb._                   I’m out of patience.

_Ant._ We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:
This wide-chapp’d rascal,--would thou mightst lie drowning
The washing of ten tides!

_Gon._                  He’ll be hang’d yet,
Though every drop of water swear against it,                        55
And gape at widest to glut him.

  [_A confused noise within:_ “Mercy on us!”--
  “We split, we split!”-- “Farewell my wife and children!”--
  “Farewell, brother!”-- “We split, we split, we split!”]

_Ant._ Let’s all sink with the king.                                60

_Seb._ Let’s take leave of him. [_Exeunt Ant. and Seb._

_Gon._ Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for
an acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any
thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain die a
dry death.    [_Exeunt._                                            65


SCENE II. _The island. Before PROSPERO’S cell._

  _Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA._

_Mir._ If by your art, my dearest father, you have
Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
But that the sea, mounting to the welkin’s cheek,
Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffer’d                              5
With those that I saw suffer! a brave vessel,
Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,
Dash’d all to pieces. O, the cry did knock
Against my very heart! Poor souls, they perish’d!
Had I been any god of power, I would                                10
Have sunk the sea within the earth, or ere
It should the good ship so have swallow’d and
The fraughting souls within her.

_Pros._                        Be collected:
No more amazement: tell your piteous heart
There’s no harm done.

_Mir._              O, woe the day!

_Pros._                           No harm.                          15
I have done nothing but in care of thee,
Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who
Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing
Of whence I am, nor that I am more better
Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,                          20
And thy no greater father.

_Mir._                   More to know
Did never meddle with my thoughts.

_Pros._                          ’Tis time
I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,
And pluck my magic garment from me. --So:
                                [_Lays down his mantle._
Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.              25
The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch’d
The very virtue of compassion in thee,
I have with such provision in mine art
So safely order’d, that there is no soul,
No, not so much perdition as an hair                                30
Betid to any creature in the vessel
Which thou heard’st cry, which thou saw’st sink. Sit down;
For thou must now know farther.

_Mir._                        You have often
Begun to tell me what I am; but stopp’d,
And left me to a bootless inquisition,                              35
Concluding “Stay: not yet.”

_Pros._                The hour’s now come;
The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;
Obey, and be attentive. Canst thou remember
A time before we came unto this cell?
I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not                   40
Out three years old.

_Mir._             Certainly, sir, I can.

_Pros._ By what? by any other house or person?
Of any thing the image tell me that
Hath kept with thy remembrance.

_Mir._                        ’Tis far off,
And rather like a dream than an assurance                           45
That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
Four or five women once that tended me?

_Pros._ Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it
That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else
In the dark backward and abysm of time?                             50
If thou remember’st ought ere thou camest here,
How thou camest here thou mayst.

_Mir._                         But that I do not.

_Pros._ Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
Thy father was the Duke of Milan, and
A prince of power.

_Mir._           Sir, are not you my father?                        55

_Pros._ Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and
She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father
Was Duke of Milan; and his only heir
And princess, no worse issued.

_Mir._                       O the heavens!
What foul play had we, that we came from thence?                    60
Or blessed was’t we did?

_Pros._                Both, both, my girl:
By foul play, as thou say’st, were we heaved thence;
But blessedly holp hither.

_Mir._                   O, my heart bleeds
To think o’ the teen that I have turn’d you to.
Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.                  65

_Pros._ My brother, and thy uncle, call’d Antonio,--
I pray thee, mark me,--that a brother should
Be so perfidious!--he whom, next thyself,
Of all the world I loved, and to him put
The manage of my state; as, at that time,                           70
Through all the signories it was the first,
And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed
In dignity, and for the liberal arts
Without a parallel; those being all my study,
The government I cast upon my brother,                              75
And to my state grew stranger, being transported
And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--
Dost thou attend me?

_Mir._             Sir, most heedfully.

_Pros._ Being once perfected how to grant suits,
How to deny them, whom to advance, and whom                         80
To trash for over-topping, new created
The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed ’em,
Or else new form’d ’em; having both the key
Of officer and office, set all hearts i’ the state
To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was                       85
The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,
And suck’d my verdure out on’t. Thou attend’st not.

_Mir._ O, good sir, I do.

_Pros._                 I pray thee, mark me.
I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
To closeness and the bettering of my mind                           90
With that which, but by being so retired,
O’er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother
Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,
Like a good parent, did beget of him
A falsehood in its contrary, as great                               95
As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,
A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
Not only with what my revenue yielded,
But what my power might else exact, like one
Who having into truth, by telling of it,                           100
Made such a sinner of his memory,
To credit his own lie, he did believe
He was indeed the duke; out o’ the substitution,
And executing the outward face of royalty,
With all prerogative:--hence his ambition growing,--               105
Dost thou hear?

_Mir._        Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.

_Pros._ To have no screen between this part he play’d
And him he play’d it for, he needs will be
Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library
Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties                    110
He thinks me now incapable; confederates,
So dry he was for sway, wi’ the King of Naples
To give him annual tribute, do him homage,
Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend
The dukedom, yet unbow’d,--alas, poor Milan!--                     115
To most ignoble stooping.

_Mir._                  O the heavens!

_Pros._ Mark his condition, and th’ event; then tell me
If this might be a brother.

_Mir._                    I should sin
To think but nobly of my grandmother:
Good wombs have borne bad sons.

_Pros._                       Now the condition.                   120
This King of Naples, being an enemy
To me inveterate, hearkens my brother’s suit;
Which was, that he, in lieu o’ the premises,
Of homage and I know not how much tribute,
Should presently extirpate me and mine                             125
Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan,
With all the honours, on my brother: whereon,
A treacherous army levied, one midnight
Fated to the purpose, did Antonio open
The gates of Milan; and, i’ the dead of darkness,                  130
The ministers for the purpose hurried thence
Me and thy crying self.

_Mir._                Alack, for pity!
I, not remembering how I cried out then,
Will cry it o’er again: it is a hint
That wrings mine eyes to’t.

_Pros._                   Hear a little further,                   135
And then I’ll bring thee to the present business
Which now’s upon ’s; without the which, this story
Were most impertinent.

_Mir._               Wherefore did they not
That hour destroy us?

_Pros._             Well demanded, wench:
My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,              140
So dear the love my people bore me; nor set
A mark so bloody on the business; but
With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,
Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared                   145
A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg’d,
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
Instinctively have quit it: there they hoist us,
To cry to the sea that roar’d to us; to sigh
To the winds, whose pity, sighing back again,                      150
Did us but loving wrong.

_Mir._                 Alack, what trouble
Was I then to you!

_Pros._          O, a cherubin
Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile,
Infused with a fortitude from heaven,
When I have deck’d the sea with drops full salt,                   155
Under my burthen groan’d; which raised in me
An undergoing stomach, to bear up
Against what should ensue.

_Mir._                   How came we ashore?

_Pros._ By Providence divine.
Some food we had, and some fresh water, that                       160
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
Out of his charity, who being then appointed
Master of this design, did give us, with
Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,
Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,              165
Knowing I loved my books, he furnish’d me
From mine own library with volumes that
I prize above my dukedom.

_Mir._                  Would I might
But ever see that man!

_Pros._              Now I arise:  [_Resumes his mantle._
Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.                    170
Here in this island we arrived; and here
Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit
Than other princesses can, that have more time
For vainer hours, and tutors not so careful.

_Mir._ Heavens thank you for’t! And now, I pray you, sir,          175
For still ’tis beating in my mind, your reason
For raising this sea-storm?

_Pros._                   Know thus far forth.
By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,
Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies
Brought to this shore; and by my prescience                        180
I find my zenith doth depend upon
A most auspicious star, whose influence
If now I court not, but omit, my fortunes
Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:
Thou art inclined to sleep; ’tis a good dulness,                   185
And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.
                                        [_Miranda sleeps._
Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.
Approach, my Ariel, come.

  _Enter _ARIEL_._

_Ari._ All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come
To answer thy best pleasure; be’t to fly,                          190
To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
On the curl’d clouds, to thy strong bidding task
Ariel and all his quality.

_Pros._                  Hast thou, spirit,
Perform’d to point the tempest that I bade thee?

_Ari._ To every article.                                           195
I boarded the king’s ship; now on the beak,
Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
I flamed amazement: sometime I’ld divide,
And burn in many places; on the topmast,
The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,                  200
Then meet and join. Jove’s lightnings, the precursors
O’ the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
And sight-outrunning were not: the fire and cracks
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
Seem to besiege, and make his bold waves tremble,                  205
Yea, his dread trident shake.

_Pros._                     My brave spirit!
Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil
Would not infect his reason?

_Ari._                     Not a soul
But felt a fever of the mad, and play’d
Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners                       210
Plunged in the foaming brine, and quit the vessel,
Then all afire with me: the king’s son, Ferdinand,
With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--
Was the first man that leap’d; cried, “Hell is empty,
And all the devils are here.”

_Pros._                 Why, that’s my spirit!                     215
But was not this nigh shore?

_Ari._                    Close by, my master.

_Pros._ But are they, Ariel, safe?

_Ari._                           Not a hair perish’d;
On their sustaining garments not a blemish,
But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,
In troops I have dispersed them ’bout the isle.                    220
The king’s son have I landed by himself;
Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
In an odd angle of the isle, and sitting,
His arms in this sad knot.

_Pros._                  Of the king’s ship
The mariners, say how thou hast disposed,                          225
And all the rest o’ the fleet.

_Ari._                       Safely in harbour
Is the king’s ship; in the deep nook, where once
Thou call’dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
From the still-vex’d Bermoothes, there she’s hid:
The mariners all under hatches stow’d;                             230
Who, with a charm join’d to their suffer’d labour,
I have left asleep: and for the rest o’ the fleet,
Which I dispersed, they all have met again,
And are upon the Mediterranean flote,
Bound sadly home for Naples;                                       235
Supposing that they saw the king’s ship wreck’d,
And his great person perish.

_Pros._                    Ariel, thy charge
Exactly is perform’d: but there’s more work.
What is the time o’ the day?

_Ari._                     Past the mid season.

_Pros._ At least two glasses. The time ’twixt six and now          240
Must by us both be spent most preciously.

_Ari._ Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,
Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,
Which is not yet perform’d me.

_Pros._                      How now? moody?
What is’t thou canst demand?

_Ari._                     My liberty.                             245

_Pros._ Before the time be out? no more!

_Ari._                                 I prithee,
Remember I have done thee worthy service;
Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served
Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise
To bate me a full year.

_Pros._               Dost thou forget                             250
From what a torment I did free thee?

_Ari._                             No.

_Pros._ Thou dost; and think’st it much to tread the ooze
Of the salt deep,
To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
To do me business in the veins o’ the earth                        255
When it is baked with frost.

_Ari._                     I do not, sir.

_Pros._ Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot
The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy
Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?

_Ari._ No, sir.

_Pros._       Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.       260

_Ari._ Sir, in Argier.

_Pros._              O, was she so? I must
Once in a month recount what thou hast been,
Which thou forget’st. This damn’d witch Sycorax,
For mischiefs manifold, and sorceries terrible
To enter human hearing, from Argier,                               265
Thou know’st, was banish’d: for one thing she did
They would not take her life. Is not this true?

_Ari._ Ay, sir.

_Pros._ This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child,
And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,                  270
As thou report’st thyself, wast then her servant;
And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate
To act her earthy and abhorr’d commands,
Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,
By help of her more potent ministers,                              275
And in her most unmitigable rage,
Into a cloven pine; within which rift
Imprison’d thou didst painfully remain
A dozen years; within which space she died,
And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans              280
As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--
Save for the son that she did litter here,
A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour’d with
A human shape.

_Ari._       Yes, Caliban her son.

_Pros._ Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban,                    285
Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know’st
What torment I did find thee in; thy groans
Did make wolves howl, and penetrate the breasts
Of ever-angry bears: it was a torment
To lay upon the damn’d, which Sycorax                              290
Could not again undo: it was mine art,
When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape
The pine, and let thee out.

_Ari._                    I thank thee, master.

_Pros._ If thou more murmur’st, I will rend an oak,
And peg thee in his knotty entrails, till                          295
Thou hast howl’d away twelve winters.

_Ari._                              Pardon, master:
I will be correspondent to command,
And do my spiriting gently.

_Pros._                   Do so; and after two days
I will discharge thee.

_Ari._               That’s my noble master!
What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?                        300

_Pros._ Go make thyself like a nymph o’ the sea:
Be subject to no sight but thine and mine; invisible
To every eyeball else. Go take this shape,
And hither come in’t: go, hence with diligence!

    [_Exit Ariel._

Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well;                    305
Awake!

_Mir._ The strangeness of your story put
Heaviness in me.

_Pros._        Shake it off. Come on;
We’ll visit Caliban my slave, who never
Yields us kind answer.

_Mir._               ’Tis a villain, sir,
I do not love to look on.

_Pros._                 But, as ’tis,                              310
We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,
Fetch in our wood, and serves in offices
That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!
Thou earth, thou! speak.

_Cal._ [_within_] There’s wood enough within.

_Pros._ Come forth, I say! there’s other business for thee:        315
Come, thou tortoise! when?

  _Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph._

Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,
Hark in thine ear.

_Ari._           My lord, it shall be done.    [_Exit._

_Pros._ Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself
Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!                                   320

  _Enter CALIBAN._

_Cal._ As wicked dew as e’er my mother brush’d
With raven’s feather from unwholesome fen
Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye
And blister you all o’er!

_Pros._ For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,        325
Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins
Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,
All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch’d
As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
Than bees that made ’em.

_Cal._                 I must eat my dinner.                       330
This island’s mine, by Sycorax my mother,
Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,
Thou strokedst me, and madest much of me; wouldst give me
Water with berries in’t; and teach me how
To name the bigger light, and how the less,                        335
That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee,
And show’d thee all the qualities o’ th’ isle,
The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:
Curs’d be I that did so! All the charms
Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!                    340
For I am all the subjects that you have,
Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me
In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me
The rest o’ th’ island.

_Pros._               Thou most lying slave,
Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,             345
Filth as thou art, with human care; and lodged thee
In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate
The honour of my child.

_Cal._ O ho, O ho! would ’t had been done!
Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else                          350
This isle with Calibans.

_Pros._                Abhorred slave,
Which any print of goodness wilt not take,
Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,
Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour
One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,                   355
Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
A thing most brutish, I endow’d thy purposes
With words that made them known. But thy vile race,
Though thou didst learn, had that in’t which good natures
Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou                    360
Deservedly confined into this rock,
Who hadst deserved more than a prison.

_Cal._ You taught me language; and my profit on’t
Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you
For learning me your language!

_Pros._                      Hag-seed, hence!                      365
Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou’rt best,
To answer other business. Shrug’st thou, malice?
If thou neglect’st, or dost unwillingly
What I command, I’ll rack thee with old cramps,
Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar,                     370
That beasts shall tremble at thy din.

_Cal._                              No, pray thee.
[_Aside_] I must obey: his art is of such power,
It would control my dam’s god, Setebos,
And make a vassal of him.

_Pros._                 So, slave; hence!    [_Exit Caliban._

  _Re-enter ARIEL, invisible, playing and singing; FERDINAND
  following._

_ARIEL’S song._

    Come unto these yellow sands,                                  375
        And then take hands:
    Courtsied when you have and kiss’d
        The wild waves whist:
    Foot it featly here and there;
    And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.                          380

 _Burthen_ [_dispersedly_]. Hark, hark!
                           Bow-wow.
        The watch-dogs bark:
                            Bow-wow.

_Ari._  Hark, hark! I hear
        The strain of strutting chanticleer                        385
        Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow.

_Fer._ Where should this music be? i’ th’ air or th’ earth?
It sounds no more: and, sure, it waits upon
Some god o’ th’ island. Sitting on a bank,
Weeping again the king my father’s wreck,                          390
This music crept by me upon the waters,
Allaying both their fury and my passion
With its sweet air: thence I have follow’d it.
Or it hath drawn me rather. But ’tis gone.
No, it begins again.                                               395

_ARIEL sings._

    Full fathom five thy father lies;
        Of his bones are coral made;
    Those are pearls that were his eyes:
        Nothing of him that doth fade,
    But doth suffer a sea-change                                   400
    Into something rich and strange.
    Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:

                    _Burthen:_ Ding-dong.

_Ari._ Hark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell.

_Fer._ The ditty does remember my drown’d father.                  405
This is no mortal business, nor no sound
That the earth owes:--I hear it now above me.

_Pros._ The fringed curtains of thine eye advance,
And say what thou seest yond.

_Mir._                      What is’t? a spirit?
Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,                         410
It carries a brave form. But ’tis a spirit.

_Pros._ No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest
Was in the wreck; and, but he’s something stain’d
With grief, that’s beauty’s canker, thou mightst call him          415
A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows,
And strays about to find ’em.

_Mir._                      I might call him
A thing divine; for nothing natural
I ever saw so noble.

_Pros._ [_Aside_] It goes on, I see,
As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I’ll free thee         420
Within two days for this.

_Fer._                  Most sure, the goddess
On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer
May know if you remain upon this island;
And that you will some good instruction give
How I may bear me here: my prime request,                          425
Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!
If you be maid or no?

_Mir._              No wonder, sir;
But certainly a maid.

_Fer._              My language! heavens!
I am the best of them that speak this speech,
Were I but where ’tis spoken.

_Pros._                     How? the best?                         430
What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?

_Fer._ A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;
And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,
Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld                     435
The king my father wreck’d.

_Mir._                    Alack, for mercy!

_Fer._ Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan
And his brave son being twain.

_Pros._                      [_Aside_] The Duke of Milan
And his more braver daughter could control thee,
If now ’twere fit to do’t. At the first sight                      440
They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,
I’ll set thee free for this. [_To Fer._] A word, good sir;
I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.

_Mir._ Why speaks my father so ungently? This
Is the third man that e’er I saw; the first                        445
That e’er I sigh’d for: pity move my father
To be inclined my way!

_Fer._               O, if a virgin,
And your affection not gone forth, I’ll make you
The queen of Naples.

_Pros._            Soft, sir! one word more.
[_Aside_] They are both in either’s powers:
        but this swift business                                    450
I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
Make the prize light. [_To Fer._] One word more; I charge thee
That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp
The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself
Upon this island as a spy, to win it                               455
From me, the lord on’t.

_Fer._                No, as I am a man.

_Mir._ There’s nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:
If the ill spirit have so fair a house,
Good things will strive to dwell with’t.

_Pros._                                Follow me.
Speak not you for him; he’s a traitor. Come;                       460
I’ll manacle thy neck and feet together:
Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be
The fresh-brook muscles, wither’d roots, and husks
Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.

_Fer._                           No;
I will resist such entertainment till                              465
Mine enemy has more power.
            [_Draws, and is charmed from moving._

_Mir._                O dear father,
Make not too rash a trial of him, for
He’s gentle, and not fearful.

_Pros._                     What! I say,
My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;
Who makest a show, but darest not strike, thy conscience           470
Is so possess’d with guilt: come from thy ward;
For I can here disarm thee with this stick
And make thy weapon drop.

_Mir._                  Beseech you, father.

_Pros._ Hence! hang not on my garments.

_Mir._                                Sir, have pity;
I’ll be his surety.

_Pros._           Silence! one word more                           475
Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
An advocate for an impostor! hush!
Thou think’st there is no more such shapes as he,
Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!
To the most of men this is a Caliban,                              480
And they to him are angels.

_Mir._                    My affections
Are, then, most humble; I have no ambition
To see a goodlier man.

_Pros._              Come on; obey:
Thy nerves are in their infancy again,
And have no vigour in them.

_Fer._             So they are:                                    485
My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.
My father’s loss, the weakness which I feel,
The wreck of all my friends, nor this man’s threats,
To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,
Might I but through my prison once a day                           490
Behold this maid: all corners else o’ th’ earth
Let liberty make use of; space enough
Have I in such a prison.

_Pros._ [_Aside_]      It works. [_To Fer._] Come on.
Thou hast done well, fine Ariel! [_To Fer._] Follow me.
[_To Ari._] Hark what thou else shalt do me.

_Mir._                                     Be of comfort;          495
My father’s of a better nature, sir,
Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted
Which now came from him.

_Pros._                Thou shalt be as free
As mountain winds: but then exactly do
All points of my command.

_Ari._                  To the syllable.                           500

_Pros._ Come, follow. Speak not for him.    [_Exeunt._




ACT II.


SCENE I. _Another part of the island._

  _Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO,
  and others._

_Gon._ Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
So have we all, of joy; for our escape
Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
Is common; every day, some sailor’s wife,
The masters of some merchant, and the merchant,                      5
Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,
I mean our preservation, few in millions
Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh
Our sorrow with our comfort.

_Alon._                    Prithee, peace.

_Seb._ He receives comfort like cold porridge.                      10

_Ant._ The visitor will not give him o’er so.

_Seb._ Look, he’s winding up the watch of his wit; by
and by it will strike.

_Gon._ Sir,--

_Seb._ One: tell.                                                   15

_Gon._ When every grief is entertain’d that’s offer’d,
Comes to the entertainer--

_Seb._ A dollar.

_Gon._ Dolour comes to him, indeed: you have spoken
truer than you purposed.                                            20

_Seb._ You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.

_Gon._ Therefore, my lord,--

_Ant._ Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!

_Alon._ I prithee, spare.

_Gon._ Well, I have done: but yet,--                                25

_Seb._ He will be talking.

_Ant._ Which, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first
begins to crow?

_Seb._ The old cock.

_Ant._ The cockerel.                                                30

_Seb._ Done. The wager?

_Ant._ A laughter.

_Seb._ A match!

_Adr._ Though this island seem to be desert,--

_Seb._ Ha, ha, ha!--So, you’re paid.                                35

_Adr._ Uninhabitable, and almost inaccessible,--

_Seb._ Yet,--

_Adr._ Yet,--

_Ant._ He could not miss’t.

_Adr._ It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate              40
temperance.

_Ant._ Temperance was a delicate wench.

_Seb._ Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.

_Adr._ The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.

_Seb._ As if it had lungs, and rotten ones.                         45

_Ant._ Or as ’twere perfumed by a fen.

_Gon._ Here is every thing advantageous to life.

_Ant._ True; save means to live.

_Seb._ Of that there’s none, or little.

_Gon._ How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!               50

_Ant._ The ground, indeed, is tawny.

_Seb._ With an eye of green in’t.

_Ant._ He misses not much.

_Seb._ No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.

_Gon._ But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost             55
beyond credit,--

_Seb._ As many vouched rarities are.

_Gon._ That our garments, being, as they were, drenched
in the sea, hold, notwithstanding, their freshness and glosses,
being rather new-dyed than stained with salt water.                 60

_Ant._ If but one of his pockets could speak, would it
not say he lies?

_Seb._ Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.

_Gon._ Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when
we put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of the king’s        65
fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.

_Seb._ ’Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in
our return.

_Adr._ Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon
to their queen.                                                     70

_Gon._ Not since widow Dido’s time.

_Ant._ Widow! a pox o’ that! How came that widow
in? widow Dido!

_Seb._ What if he had said ‘widower Æneas’ too? Good
Lord, how you take it!                                              75

_Adr._ ‘Widow Dido’ said you? you make me study of
that: she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.

_Gon._ This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.

_Adr._ Carthage?

_Gon._ I assure you, Carthage.                                      80

_Seb._ His word is more than the miraculous harp; he
hath raised the wall, and houses too.

_Ant._ What impossible matter will he make easy next?

_Seb._ I think he will carry this island home in his
pocket, and give it his son for an apple.                           85

_Ant._ And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring
forth more islands.

_Gon._ Ay.

_Ant._ Why, in good time.

_Gon._ Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now              90
as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your
daughter, who is now queen.

_Ant._ And the rarest that e’er came there.

_Seb._ Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.

_Ant._ O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.                               95

_Gon._ Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I
wore it? I mean, in a sort.

_Ant._ That sort was well fished for.

_Gon._ When I wore it at your daughter’s marriage?

_Alon._ You cram these words into mine ears against                100
The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,
My son is lost, and, in my rate, she too.
Who is so far from Italy removed
I ne’er again shall see her. O thou mine heir                      105
Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
Hath made his meal on thee?

_Fran._                   Sir, he may live:
I saw him beat the surges under him,
And ride upon their backs; he trod the water.
Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted                          110
The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head
’Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar’d
Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
To the shore, that o’er his wave-worn basis bow’d,
As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt                            115
He came alive to land.

_Alon._              No, no, he’s gone.

_Seb._ Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
But rather lose her to an African;
Where she, at least, is banish’d from your eye,                    120
Who hath cause to wet the grief on’t.

_Alon._                             Prithee, peace.

_Seb._ You were kneel’d to, and importuned otherwise,
By all of us; and the fair soul herself
Weigh’d between loathness and obedience, at
Which end o’ the beam should bow. We have lost your son,           125
I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have
More widows in them of this business’ making
Than we bring men to comfort them:
The fault’s your own.

_Alon._             So is the dear’st o’ the loss.

_Gon._ My lord Sebastian,                                          130
The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness,
And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,
When you should bring the plaster.

_Seb._                           Very well.

_Ant._ And most chirurgeonly.

_Gon._ It is foul weather in us all, good sir,                     135
When you are cloudy.

_Seb._             Foul weather?

_Ant._                         Very foul.

_Gon._ Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--

_Ant._ He’ld sow’t with nettle-seed.

_Seb._                             Or docks, or mallows.

_Gon._ And were the king on’t, what would I do?

_Seb._ ’Scape being drunk for want of wine.                        140

_Gon._ I’ the commonwealth I would by contraries
Execute all things; for no kind of traffic
Would I admit; no name of magistrate;
Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,
And use of service, none; contract, succession,                    145
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
No occupation; all men idle, all;
And women too, but innocent and pure;
No sovereignty;--                                                  150

_Seb._      Yet he would be king on’t.

_Ant._ The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
beginning.

_Gon._ All things in common nature should produce
Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,                    155
Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,
Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,
To feed my innocent people.

_Seb._ No marrying ’mong his subjects?

_Ant._ None, man; all idle; whores and knaves.                     160

_Gon._ I would with such perfection govern, sir,
To excel the golden age.

_Seb._                 ’Save his majesty!

_Ant._ Long live Gonzalo!

_Gon._                  And,--do you mark me, sir?

_Alon._ Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.

_Gon._ I do well believe your highness; and did it to minister     165
occasion to these gentlemen, who are of such sensible
and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing.

_Ant._ ’Twas you we laughed at.

_Gon._ Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to
you: so you may continue, and laugh at nothing still.              170

_Ant._ What a blow was there given!

_Seb._ An it had not fallen flat-long.

_Gon._ You are gentlemen of brave mettle; you would
lift the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue in it
five weeks without changing.                                       175


  _Enter ARIEL (invisible) playing solemn music._

_Seb._ We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.

_Ant._ Nay, good my lord, be not angry.

_Gon._ No, I warrant you; I will not adventure my discretion
so weakly. Will you laugh me asleep, for I am very
heavy?                                                             180

_Ant._ Go sleep, and hear us.
            [_All sleep except Alon., Seb., and Ant._

_Alon._ What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find
They are inclined to do so.

_Seb._                    Please you, sir,
Do not omit the heavy offer of it:                                 185
It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
It is a comforter.

_Ant._           We two, my lord,
Will guard your person while you take your rest,
And watch your safety.

_Alon._              Thank you.--Wondrous heavy.
                                [_Alonso sleeps. Exit Ariel._

_Seb._ What a strange drowsiness possesses them!                   190

_Ant._ It is the quality o’ the climate.

_Seb._                                 Why
Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not
Myself disposed to sleep.

_Ant._                  Nor I; my spirits are nimble.
They fell together all, as by consent;
They dropp’d, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,                  195
Worthy Sebastian?--O, what might?--No more:--
And yet methinks I see it in thy face,
What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee; and
My strong imagination sees a crown
Dropping upon thy head.

_Seb._                What, art thou waking?                       200

_Ant._ Do you not hear me speak?

_Seb._                         I do; and surely
It is a sleepy language, and thou speak’st
Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
This is a strange repose, to be asleep
With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,                   205
And yet so fast asleep.

_Ant._                Noble Sebastian,
Thou let’st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink’st
Whiles thou art waking.

_Seb._                Thou dost snore distinctly;
There’s meaning in thy snores.

_Ant._ I am more serious than my custom: you                       210
Must be so too, if heed me; which to do
Trebles thee o’er.

_Seb._           Well, I am standing water.

_Ant._ I’ll teach you how to flow.

_Seb._                           Do so: to ebb
Hereditary sloth instructs me.

_Ant._                       O,
If you but knew how you the purpose cherish                        215
Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,
You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,
Most often do so near the bottom run
By their own fear or sloth.

_Seb._                    Prithee, say on:
The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim                        220
A matter from thee; and a birth, indeed,
Which throes thee much to yield.

_Ant._                         Thus, sir:
Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,
Who shall be of as little memory
When he is earth’d, hath here almost persuaded,--                  225
For he’s a spirit of persuasion, only
Professes to persuade,--the king his son’s alive,
’Tis as impossible that he’s undrown’d
As he that sleeps here swims.

_Seb._                      I have no hope
That he’s undrown’d.

_Ant._             O, out of that ‘no hope’                        230
What great hope have you! no hope that way is
Another way so high a hope that even
Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,
But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me
That Ferdinand is drown’d?

_Seb._                   He’s gone.

_Ant._                            Then, tell me,                   235
Who’s the next heir of Naples?

_Seb._                       Claribel.

_Ant._ She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells
Ten leagues beyond man’s life; she that from Naples
Can have no note, unless the sun were post,--
The man i’ the moon’s too slow,--till new-born chins               240
Be rough and razorable; she that from whom
We all were sea-swallow’d, though some cast again,
And by that destiny, to perform an act
Whereof what’s past is prologue; what to come,
In yours and my discharge.

_Seb._                   What stuff is this! How say you?          245
’Tis true, my brother’s daughter’s queen of Tunis;
So is she heir of Naples; ’twixt which regions
There is some space.

_Ant._             A space whose every cubit
Seems to cry out, “How shall that Claribel
Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,                          250
And let Sebastian wake.” Say, this were death
That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse
Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples
As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate
As amply and unnecessarily                                         255
As this Gonzalo; I myself could make
A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore
The mind that I do! what a sleep were this
For your advancement! Do you understand me?

_Seb._ Methinks I do.

_Ant._              And how does your content                      260
Tender your own good fortune?

_Seb._                      I remember
You did supplant your brother Prospero.

_Ant._                                True:
And look how well my garments sit upon me;
Much feater than before: my brother’s servants
Were then my fellows; now they are my men.                         265

_Seb._ But for your conscience.

_Ant._ Ay, sir; where lies that? if ’twere a kibe,
’Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not
This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,
That stand ’twixt me and Milan, candied be they,                   270
And melt, ere they molest! Here lies your brother,
No better than the earth he lies upon,
If he were that which now he’s like, that’s dead;
Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,
Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,                   275
To the perpetual wink for aye might put
This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who
Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,
They’ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;
They’ll tell the clock to any business that                        280
We say befits the hour.

_Seb._                Thy case, dear friend,
Shall be my precedent; as thou got’st Milan,
I’ll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke
Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;
And I the king shall love thee.

_Ant._                        Draw together;                       285
And when I rear my hand, do you the like,
To fall it on Gonzalo.

_Seb._               O, but one word.      [_They talk apart._

  _Re-enter ARIEL invisible._

_Ari._ My master through his art foresees the danger
That you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth,--
For else his project dies,--to keep them living.                   290
                            [_Sings in Gonzalo’s ear._

While you here do snoring lie,
Open-eyed conspiracy
    His time doth take.
If of life you keep a care,
Shake off slumber, and beware:                                     295
    Awake, awake!

_Ant._ Then let us both be sudden.

_Gon._                           Now, good angels
Preserve the king!                          [_They wake._

_Alon._ Why, how now? ho, awake!--Why are you drawn?
Wherefore this ghastly looking?

_Gon._                        What’s the matter?                   300

_Seb._ Whiles we stood here securing your repose,
Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing
Like bulls, or rather lions: did’t not wake you?
It struck mine ear most terribly.

_Alon._                         I heard nothing.

_Ant._ O, ’twas a din to fright a monster’s ear,                   305
To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roar
Of a whole herd of lions.

_Alon._                 Heard you this, Gonzalo?

_Gon._ Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,
And that a strange one too, which did awake me:
I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open’d,                 310
I saw their weapons drawn:--there was a noise,
That’s verily. ’Tis best we stand upon our guard,
Or that we quit this place: let’s draw our weapons.

_Alon._ Lead off this ground; and let’s make further search
For my poor son.

_Gon._         Heavens keep him from these beasts!                 315
For he is, sure, i’ th’ island.

_Alon._                       Lead away.

_Ari._ Prospero my lord shall know what I have done:
So, king, go safely on to seek thy son.    [_Exeunt._





SCENE II. _Another part of the island._

  _Enter CALIBAN with a burden of wood. A noise of thunder heard._

_Cal._ All the infections that the sun sucks up
From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall, and make him
By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me,
And yet I needs must curse. But they’ll nor pinch,
Fright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i’ the mire,                   5
Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark
Out of my way, unless he bid ’em: but
For every trifle are they set upon me;
Sometime like apes, that mow and chatter at me,
And after bite me; then like hedgehogs, which                       10
Lie tumbling in my barefoot way, and mount
Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I
All wound with adders, who with cloven tongues
Do hiss me into madness.

  _Enter TRINCULO._

                        Lo, now, lo!
Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me                       15
For bringing wood in slowly. I’ll fall flat;
Perchance he will not mind me.

_Trin._ Here’s neither bush nor shrub, to bear off any
weather at all, and another storm brewing; I hear it sing i’
the wind: yond same black cloud, yond huge one, looks               20
like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor. If it should
thunder as it did before, I know not where to hide my head:
yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls. What
have we here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish: he
smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-like smell; a kind      25
of not of the newest Poor-John. A strange fish! Were I
in England now, as once I was, and had but this fish
painted, not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of
silver: there would this monster make a man; any strange
beast there makes a man: when they will not give a doit to          30
relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead
Indian. Legged like a man! and his fins like arms! Warm
o’ my troth! I do now let loose my opinion; hold it no
longer: this is no fish, but an islander, that hath lately
suffered by a thunderbolt. [_Thunder._] Alas, the storm is come     35
again! my best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there
is no other shelter hereabout: misery acquaints a man with
strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the dregs of the
storm be past.

  _Enter STEPHANO, singing: a bottle in his hand._

_Ste._ I shall no more to sea, to sea,                              40
                Here shall I die a-shore,--

This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man’s funeral: well,
here’s my comfort.                                  [_Drinks._


[_Sings._ The master, the swabber, the boatswain, and I,
                       The gunner, and his mate,                    45
               Loved Mall, Meg, and Marian, and Margery,
                   But none of us cared for Kate;
                   For she had a tongue with a tang,
                   Would cry to a sailor, Go hang!
               She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch;        50
               Yet a tailor might scratch her where’er she did itch.
                   Then, to sea, boys, and let her go hang!

This is a scurvy tune too: but here’s my comfort. [_Drinks._

_Cal._ Do not torment me:--O!

_Ste._ What’s the matter? Have we devils here? Do                   55
you put tricks upon ’s with savages and men of Ind, ha? I
have not scaped drowning, to be afeard now of your four
legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man as ever went
on four legs cannot make him give ground; and it shall be
said so again, while Stephano breathes at’s nostrils.               60

_Cal._ The spirit torments me:--O!

_Ste._ This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who
hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil should he
learn our language? I will give him some relief, if it be
but for that. If I can recover him, and keep him tame, and          65
get to Naples with him, he’s a present for any emperor that
ever trod on neat’s-leather.

_Cal._ Do not torment me, prithee; I’ll bring my wood
home faster.

_Ste._ He’s in his fit now, and does not talk after the             70
wisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he have never drunk
wine afore, it will go near to remove his fit. If I can recover
him, and keep him tame, I will not take too much for
him; he shall pay for him that hath him, and that soundly.

_Cal._ Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon, I          75
know it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee.

_Ste._ Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is that
which will give language to you, cat: open your mouth; this
will shake your shaking, I can tell you, and that soundly:
you cannot tell who’s your friend: open your chaps again.           80

_Trin._ I should know that voice: it should be--but he
is drowned; and these are devils:--O defend me!

_Ste._ Four legs and two voices,--a most delicate monster!
His forward voice, now, is to speak well of his friend;
his backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract.        85
If all the wine in my bottle will recover him, I will help
his ague. Come:--Amen! I will pour some in thy other
mouth.

_Trin._ Stephano!

_Ste._ Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy!                  90
This is a devil, and no monster: I will leave him; I have
no long spoon.

_Trin._ Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me,
and speak to me; for I am Trinculo,--be not afeard,--thy
good friend Trinculo.                                               95

_Ste._ If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I’ll pull thee
by the lesser legs: if any be Trinculo’s legs, these are they.
Thou art very Trinculo indeed! How earnest thou to be
the siege of this moon-calf? can he vent Trinculos?

_Trin._ I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke.             100
But art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope, now, thou
art not drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid me
under the dead moon-calf’s gaberdine for fear of the storm.
And art thou living, Stephano? O Stephano, two Neapolitans
scaped!                                                            105

_Ste._ Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not
constant.

_Cal._ [_aside_] These be fine things, an if they be not sprites.
That’s a brave god, and bears celestial liquor:
I will kneel to him.                                               110

_Ste._ How didst thou ’scape? How camest thou hither?
swear, by this bottle, how thou camest hither. I escaped
upon a butt of sack, which the sailors heaved o’erboard, by
this bottle! which I made of the bark of a tree with mine
own hands, since I was cast ashore.                                115

_Cal._ I’ll swear, upon that bottle, to be thy true subject;
for the liquor is not earthly.

_Ste._ Here; swear, then, how thou escapedst.

_Trin._ Swum ashore, man, like a duck: I can swim
like a duck, I’ll be sworn.                                        120

_Ste._ Here, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim
like a duck, thou art made like a goose.

_Trin._ O Stephano, hast any more of this?

_Ste._ The whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by
the sea-side, where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf!            125
how does thine ague?

_Cal._ Hast thou not dropp’d from heaven?

_Ste._ Out o’ the moon, I do assure thee: I was the man
i’ the moon when time was.

_Cal._ I have seen thee in her, and I do adore thee:               130
My mistress show’d me thee, and thy dog, and thy bush.

_Ste._ Come, swear to that; kiss the book: I will furnish
it anon with new contents: swear.

_Trin._ By this good light, this is a very shallow monster!
I afeard of him! A very weak monster! The                          135
man i’ the moon! A most poor credulous monster! Well
drawn, monster, in good sooth!

_Cal._ I’ll show thee every fertile inch o’ th’ island;
And I will kiss thy foot: I prithee, be my god.

_Trin._ By this light, a most perfidious and drunken               140
monster! when’s god’s asleep, he’ll rob his bottle.

_Cal._ I’ll kiss thy foot; I’ll swear myself thy subject.

_Ste._ Come on, then; down, and swear.

_Trin._ I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed
monster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in                    145
my heart to beat him,--

_Ste._ Come, kiss.

_Trin._ But that the poor monster’s in drink: an abominable
monster!

_Cal._ I’ll show thee the best springs; I’ll pluck thee berries;   150
I’ll fish for thee, and get thee wood enough.
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
I’ll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,
Thou wondrous man.

_Trin._ A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder                155
of a poor drunkard!

_Cal._ I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow;
And I with my long nails will dig thee pig-nuts;
Show thee a jay’s nest, and instruct thee how
To snare the nimble marmoset; I’ll bring thee                      160
To clustering filberts, and sometimes I’ll get thee
Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?

_Ste._ I prithee now, lead the way, without any more
talking. Trinculo, the king and all our company else being
drowned, we will inherit here: here; bear my bottle: fellow        165
Trinculo, we’ll fill him by and by again.

_Cal. sings drunkenly._] Farewell, master; farewell, farewell!

_Trin._ A howling monster; a drunken monster!

_Cal._ No more dams I’ll make for fish;
                Nor fetch in firing                                170
                At requiring;
             Nor scrape trencher, nor wash dish:
                ’Ban, ’Ban, Cacaliban
                Has a new master:--get a new man.

Freedom, hey-day! hey-day, freedom! freedom, hey-day,              175
freedom!

_Ste._ O brave monster! Lead the way.    [_Exeunt._






ACT III.


SCENE I. _Before PROSPERO’S cell._

  _Enter FERDINAND, bearing a log._

_Fer._ There be some sports are painful, and their labour
Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness
Are nobly undergone, and most poor matters
Point to rich ends. This my mean task
Would be as heavy to me as odious, but                               5
The mistress which I serve quickens what’s dead,
And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is
Ten times more gentle than her father’s crabbed.
And he’s composed of harshness. I must remove
Some thousands of these logs, and pile them up,                     10
Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress
Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness
Had never like executor. I forget:
But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,
Most busy lest, when I do it.

  _Enter MIRANDA; and PROSPERO at a distance, unseen._

_Mir._                  Alas, now, pray you,                        15
Work not so hard: I would the lightning had
Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin’d to pile!
Pray, set it down, and rest you: when this burns,
’Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
Is hard at study; pray, now, rest yourself;                         20
He’s safe for these three hours.

_Fer._                         O most dear mistress,
The sun will set before I shall discharge
What I must strive to do.

_Mir._                  If you’ll sit down,
I’ll bear your logs the while: pray, give me that;
I’ll carry it to the pile.

_Fer._                   No, precious creature;                     25
I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,
Than you should such dishonour undergo,
While I sit lazy by.

_Mir._             It would become me
As well as it does you: and I should do it
With much more ease; for my good will is to it,                     30
And yours it is against.

_Pros._                Poor worm, thou art infected!
This visitation shows it.

_Mir._                  You look wearily.

_Fer._ No, noble mistress; ’tis fresh morning with me
When you are by at night. I do beseech you,--
Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers,--                        35
What is your name?

_Mir._           Miranda. --O my father,
I have broke your hest to say so!

_Fer._                          Admired Miranda!
Indeed the top of admiration! worth
What’s dearest to the world! Full many a lady
I have eyed with best regard, and many a time                       40
The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues
Have I liked several women; never any
With so full soul, but some defect in her
Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed,                        45
And put it to the foil: but you, O you,
So perfect and so peerless, are created
Of every creature’s best!

_Mir._             I do not know
One of my sex; no woman’s face remember,
Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen                      50
More that I may call men than you, good friend,
And my dear father: how features are abroad,
I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,
The jewel in my dower, I would not wish
Any companion in the world but you;                                 55
Nor can imagination form a shape,
Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle
Something too wildly, and my father’s precepts
I therein do forget.

_Fer._             I am, in my condition,
A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king;                              60
I would, not so!--and would no more endure
This wooden slavery than to suffer
The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:
The very instant that I saw you, did
My heart fly to your service; there resides,                        65
To make me slave to it; and for your sake
Am I this patient log-man.

_Mir._                   Do you love me?

_Fer._ O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound,
And crown what I profess with kind event,
If I speak true! if hollowly, invert                                70
What best is boded me to mischief! I,
Beyond all limit of what else i’ the world,
Do love, prize, honour you.

_Mir._                    I am a fool
To weep at what I am glad of.

_Pros._                     Fair encounter
Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace                     75
On that which breeds between ’em!

_Fer._                          Wherefore weep you?

_Mir._ At mine unworthiness, that dare not offer
What I desire to give; and much less take
What I shall die to want. But this is trifling;
And all the more it seeks to hide itself,                           80
The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!
And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!
I am your wife, if you will marry me;
If not, I’ll die your maid: to be your fellow
You may deny me; but I’ll be your servant,                          85
Whether you will or no.

_Fer._                My mistress, dearest;
And I thus humble ever.

_Mir._                My husband, then?

_Fer._ Ay, with a heart as willing
As bondage e’er of freedom: here’s my hand.

_Mir._ And mine, with my heart in’t: and now farewell               90
Till half an hour hence.

_Fer._                 A thousand thousand!

    [_Exeunt Fer. and Mir. severally._

_Pros._ So glad of this as they I cannot be,
Who are surprised withal; but my rejoicing
At nothing can be more. I’ll to my book;
For yet, ere supper-time, must I perform                            95
Much business appertaining.    [_Exit._


  


SCENE II. _Another part of the island._

  _Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO._

_Ste._ Tell not me;--when the butt is out, we will drink
water; not a drop before: therefore bear up, and board ’em.
Servant-monster, drink to me.

_Trin._ Servant-monster! the folly of this island! They
say there’s but five upon this isle: we are three of them; if        5
th’ other two be brained like us, the state totters.

_Ste._ Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyes
are almost set in thy head.

_Trin._ Where should they be set else? he were a brave
monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.                       10

_Ste._ My man-monster hath drowned his tongue in sack:
for my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I could
recover the shore, five-and-thirty leagues off and on. By
this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant, monster, or my
standard.                                                           15

_Trin._ Your lieutenant, if you list; he’s no standard.

_Ste._ We’ll not run, Monsieur Monster.

_Trin._ Nor go neither; but you’ll lie, like dogs, and
yet say nothing neither.

_Ste._ Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a           20
good moon-calf.

_Cal._ How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.
I’ll not serve him, he is not valiant.

_Trin._ Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case
to justle a constable. Why, thou debauched fish, thou, was          25
there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as
I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being but half a
fish and half a monster?

_Cal._ Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord?

_Trin._ ‘Lord,’ quoth he! That a monster should be                  30
such a natural!

_Cal._ Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I prithee.

_Ste._ Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if you
prove a mutineer,--the next tree! The poor monster’s my
subject, and he shall not suffer indignity.                         35

_Cal._ I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased to
hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?

_Ste._ Marry, will I: kneel and repeat it; I will stand,
and so shall Trinculo.

  _Enter ARIEL, invisible._

_Cal._ As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a           40
sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.

_Ari._ Thou liest.

_Cal._           Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou:
I would my valiant master would destroy thee!
I do not lie.

_Ste._ Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in’s tale, by          45
this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.

_Trin._ Why, I said nothing.

_Ste._ Mum, then, and no more. Proceed.

_Cal._ I say, by sorcery he got this isle;
From me he got it. If thy greatness will                            50
Revenge it on him,--for I know thou darest,
But this thing dare not,--

_Ste._ That’s most certain.

_Cal._ Thou shalt be lord of it, and I’ll serve thee.

_Ste._ How now shall this be compassed? Canst thou                  55
bring me to the party?

_Cal._ Yea, yea, my lord: I’ll yield him thee asleep,
Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head.

_Ari._ Thou liest; thou canst not.

_Cal._ What a pied ninny’s this! Thou scurvy patch!                 60
I do beseech thy Greatness, give him blows,
And take his bottle from him: when that’s gone,
He shall drink nought but brine; for I’ll not show him
Where the quick freshes are.

_Ste._ Trinculo, run into no further danger: interrupt the          65
monster one word further, and, by this hand, I’ll turn my
mercy out o’ doors, and make a stock-fish of thee.

_Trin._ Why, what did I? I did nothing. I’ll go farther
off.

_Ste._ Didst thou not say he lied?                                  70

_Ari._ Thou liest.

_Ste._ Do I so? take thou that. [_Beats him._] As you
like this, give me the lie another time.

_Trin._ I did not give the lie. Out o’ your wits, and
hearing too? A pox o’ your bottle! this can sack and                75
drinking do. A murrain on your monster, and the devil
take your fingers!

_Cal._ Ha, ha, ha!

_Ste._ Now, forward with your tale. --Prithee, stand farther
off.                                                                80

_Cal._ Beat him enough: after a little time,
I’ll beat him too.

_Ste._ Stand farther. Come, proceed.

_Cal._ Why, as I told thee, ’tis a custom with him
I’ th’ afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,
Having first seized his books; or with a log                        85
Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,
Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember
First to possess his books; for without them
He’s but a sot, as I am, nor hath not
One spirit to command: they all do hate him                         90
As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.
He has brave utensils,--for so he calls them,--
Which, when he has a house, he’ll deck withal.
And that most deeply to consider is
The beauty of his daughter; he himself                              95
Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,
But only Sycorax my dam and she;
But she as far surpasseth Sycorax
As great’st does least.

_Ste._                Is it so brave a lass?

_Cal._ Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant,               100
And bring thee forth brave brood.

_Ste._ Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and I
will be king and queen,--save our Graces!--and Trinculo
and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou like the plot,
Trinculo?                                                          105

_Trin._ Excellent.

_Ste._ Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but,
while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.

_Cal._ Within this half hour will he be asleep:
Wilt thou destroy him then?

_Ste._                    Ay, on mine honour.                      110

_Ari._ This will I tell my master.

_Cal._ Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure:
Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch
You taught me but while-ere?

_Ste._ At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any              115
reason. --Come on. Trinculo, let us sing.      [_Sings._

  Flout ’em and scout ’em, and scout ’em and flout ’em;
  Thought is free.

_Cal._ That’s not the tune.

  [_Ariel plays the tune on a tabor and pipe._

_Ste._ What is this same?                                          120

_Trin._ This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture
of Nobody.

_Ste._ If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness:
if thou beest a devil, take’t as thou list.

_Trin._ O, forgive me my sins!                                     125

_Ste._ He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy
upon us!

_Cal._ Art thou afeard?

_Ste._ No, monster, not I.

_Cal._ Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,                  130
Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
Will hum about mine ears; and sometime voices,
That, if I then had waked after long sleep,
Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,                   135
The clouds methought would open, and show riches
Ready to drop upon me; that, when I waked,
I cried to dream again.

_Ste._ This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I
shall have my music for nothing.                                   140

_Cal._ When Prospero is destroyed.

_Ste._ That shall be by and by: I remember the story.

_Trin._ The sound is going away; let’s follow it, and
after do our work.

_Ste._ Lead, monster; we’ll follow. I would I could see            145
this taborer; he lays it on.

_Trin._ Wilt come? I’ll follow, Stephano.    [_Exeunt._


SCENE III. _Another part of the island._

  _Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO,
  and others._

_Gon._ By’r lakin, I can go no further, sir;
My old bones ache: here’s a maze trod, indeed,
Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,
I needs must rest me.

_Alon._             Old lord, I cannot blame thee,
Who am myself attach’d with weariness,                               5
To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.
Even here I will put off my hope, and keep it
No longer for my flatterer: he is drown’d
Whom thus we stray to find; and the sea mocks
Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.                     10

_Ant._ [_Aside to Seb._] I am right glad that he’s so out of hope.
Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose
That you resolved to effect.

_Seb._ [_Aside to Ant._] The next advantage
Will we take throughly.

_Ant._ [_Aside to Seb._] Let it be to-night;
For, now they are oppress’d with travel, they                       15
Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance
As when they are fresh.

_Seb._ [_Aside to Ant._] I say, to-night: no more.

  [_Solemn and strange music._

_Alon._ What harmony is this?--My good friends, hark!

_Gon._ Marvellous sweet music!

  _Enter PROSPERO above, invisible. Enter several strange Shapes,
  bringing in a banquet: they dance about it with gentle actions of
  salutation; and, inviting the King, &c. to eat, they depart._

_Alon._ Give us kind keepers, heavens!--What were these?            20

_Seb._ A living drollery. Now I will believe
That there are unicorns; that in Arabia
There is one tree, the phœnix’ throne; one phœnix
At this hour reigning there.

_Ant._                     I’ll believe both;
And what does else want credit, come to me,                         25
And I’ll be sworn ’tis true: travellers ne’er did lie,
Though fools at home condemn ’em.

_Gon._                          If in Naples
I should report this now, would they believe me?
If I should say, I saw such islanders,--
For, certes, these are people of the island,--                      30
Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,
Their manners are more gentle-kind than of
Our human generation you shall find
Many, nay, almost any.

_Pros._              [_Aside_] Honest lord,
Thou hast said well; for some of you there present                  35
Are worse than devils.

_Alon._              I cannot too much muse
Such shapes, such gesture, and such sound, expressing--
Although they want the use of tongue--a kind
Of excellent dumb discourse.

_Pros._                    [_Aside_] Praise in departing.

_Fran._ They vanish’d strangely.

_Seb._                         No matter, since                     40
They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.--
Will’t please you taste of what is here?

_Alon._                                Not I.

_Gon._ Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,
Who would believe that there were mountaineers
Dew-lapp’d like bulls, whose throats had hanging at ’em             45
Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men
Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find
Each putter-out of five for one will bring us
Good warrant of.

_Alon._        I will stand to, and feed,
Although my last: no matter, since I feel                           50
The best is past. Brother, my lord the duke,
Stand to, and do as we.

  _Thunder and lightning. Enter ARIEL, like a harpy; claps his
  wings upon the table; and, with a quaint device, the banquet
  vanishes._

_Ari._ You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,--
That hath to instrument this lower world
And what is in’t,--the never-surfeited sea                          55
Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island,
Where man doth not inhabit,--you ’mongst men
Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;
And even with such-like valour men hang and drown
Their proper selves.    [_Alon., Seb. &c. draw their swords._
                   You fools! I and my fellows                      60
Are ministers of Fate: the elements,
Of whom your swords are temper’d, may as well
Wound the loud winds, or with bemock’d-at stabs
Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish
One dowle that’s in my plume: my fellow-ministers                   65
Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,
Your swords are now too massy for your strengths,
And will not be uplifted. But remember,--
For that’s my business to you,--that you three
From Milan did supplant good Prospero;                              70
Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,
Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed
The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have
Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,
Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,                        75
They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:
Lingering perdition--worse than any death
Can be at once--shall step by step attend
You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from,--
Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls                  80
Upon your heads,--is nothing but heart-sorrow
And a clear life ensuing.

  _He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music, enter the Shapes
  again, and dance, with mocks and mows, and carrying out the
  table._

_Pros._ Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou
Perform’d, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring:
Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated                           85
In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life
And observation strange, my meaner ministers
Their several kinds have done. My high charms work,
And these mine enemies are all knit up
In their distractions: they now are in my power;                    90
And in these fits I leave them, while I visit
Young Ferdinand,--whom they suppose is drown’d,--
And his and mine loved darling.    [_Exit above._

_Gon._ I’ the name of something holy, sir, why stand you
In this strange stare?

_Alon._              O, it is monstrous, monstrous!                 95
Methought the billows spoke, and told me of it;
The winds did sing it to me; and the thunder,
That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced
The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.
Therefore my son i’ th’ ooze is bedded; and                        100
I’ll seek him deeper than e’er plummet sounded,
And with him there lie mudded.    [_Exit._

_Seb._                       But one fiend at a time,
I’ll fight their legions o’er.

_Ant._                       I’ll be thy second.

    [_Exeunt Seb. and Ant._

_Gon._ All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,
Like poison given to work a great time after,                      105
Now ’gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you,
That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly,
And hinder them from what this ecstasy
May now provoke them to.

_Adr._                 Follow, I pray you.    [_Exeunt._


 


ACT IV.


SCENE I. _Before PROSPERO’S cell._

  _Enter PROSPERO, FERDINAND, and MIRANDA._

_Pros._ If I have too austerely punish’d you,
Your compensation makes amends; for I
Have given you here a third of mine own life,
Or that for which I live; who once again
I tender to thy hand: all thy vexations                              5
Were but my trials of thy love, and thou
Hast strangely stood the test: here, afore Heaven,
I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,
Do not smile at me that I boast her off,
For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise,                   10
And make it halt behind her.

_Fer._                     I do believe it
Against an oracle.

_Pros._          Then, as my gift, and thine own acquisition
Worthily purchased, take my daughter: but
If thou dost break her virgin-knot before                           15
All sanctimonious ceremonies may
With full and holy rite be minister’d,
No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
To make this contract grow; but barren hate,
Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew                         20
The union of your bed with weeds so loathly
That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,
As Hymen’s lamps shall light you.

_Fer._                          As I hope
For quiet days, fair issue and long life,
With such love as ’tis now, the murkiest den,                       25
The most opportune place, the strong’st suggestion
Our worser Genius can, shall never melt
Mine honour into lust, to take away
The edge of that day’s celebration
When I shall think, or Phœbus’ steeds are founder’d,                30
Or Night kept chain’d below.

_Pros._                    Fairly spoke.
Sit, then, and talk with her; she is thine own.
What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel!

  _Enter ARIEL._

_Ari._ What would my potent master? here I am.

_Pros._ Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service               35
Did worthily perform; and I must use you
In such another trick. Go bring the rabble,
O’er whom I give thee power, here to this place:
Incite them to quick motion; for I must
Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple                           40
Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise,
And they expect it from me.

_Ari._                    Presently?

_Pros._ Ay, with a twink.

_Ari._ Before you can say, ‘come,’ and ‘go,’
            And breathe twice, and cry, ‘so, so,’                   45
            Each one, tripping on his toe,
            Will be here with mop and mow.
            Do you love me, master? no?

_Pros._ Dearly, my delicate Ariel. Do not approach
Till thou dost hear me call.

_Ari._                     Well, I conceive.    [_Exit._            50

_Pros._ Look thou be true; do not give dalliance
Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw
To the fire i’ the blood: be more abstemious,
Or else, good night your vow!

_Fer._                      I warrant you, sir;
The white cold virgin snow upon my heart                            55
Abates the ardour of my liver.

_Pros._                      Well.
Now come, my Ariel! bring a corollary,
Rather than want a spirit: appear, and pertly!
No tongue! all eyes! be silent.                  [_Soft music._

    _Enter IRIS._

  _Iris._ Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas                 60
    Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats, and pease;
    Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,
    And flat meads thatch’d with stover, them to keep;
    Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,
    Which spongy April at thy best betrims,                         65
    To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom-groves,
    Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,
    Being lass-lorn; thy pole-clipt vineyard;
    And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,
    Where thou thyself dost air;--the queen o’ the sky,             70
    Whose watery arch and messenger am I,
    Bids thee leave these; and with her sovereign grace,
    Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,
    To come and sport:--her peacocks fly amain:
    Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.                         75

    _Enter CERES._

  _Cer._ Hail, many-colour’d messenger, that ne’er
    Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;
    Who, with thy saffron wings, upon my flowers
    Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers;
    And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown                    80
    My bosky acres and my unshrubb’d down,
    Rich scarf to my proud earth;--why hath thy queen
    Summon’d me hither, to this short-grass’d green?

  _Iris._ A contract of true love to celebrate;
    And some donation freely to estate                              85
    On the blest lovers.

  _Cer._             Tell me, heavenly bow,
    If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,
    Do now attend the queen? Since they did plot
    The means that dusky Dis my daughter got,
    Her and her blind boy’s scandal’d company                       90
    I have forsworn.

  _Iris._        Of her society
    Be not afraid: I met her Deity
    Cutting the clouds towards Paphos, and her son
    Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done
    Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,                       95
    Whose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paid
    Till Hymen’s torch be lighted: but in vain;
    Mars’s hot minion is returned again;
    Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,
    Swears he will shoot no more, but play with sparrows,          100
    And be a boy right out.

  _Cer._                High’st queen of state,
    Great Juno, comes; I know her by her gait.

    _Enter JUNO._

  _Juno._ How does my bounteous sister? Go with me
    To bless this twain, that they may prosperous be,
    And honour’d in their issue.         [_They sing:_             105

  _Juno._ Honour, riches, marriage-blessing,
            Long continuance, and increasing,
            Hourly joys be still upon you!
            Juno sings her blessings on you.

  _Cer._  Earth’s increase, foison plenty,                         110
            Barns and garners never empty;
            Vines with clustering bunches growing;
            Plants with goodly burthen bowing;
            Spring come to you at the farthest
            In the very end of harvest!                            115
            Scarcity and want shall shun you;
            Ceres’ blessing so is on you.

_Fer._ This is a most majestic vision, and
Harmonious charmingly. May I be bold
To think these spirits?

_Pros._               Spirits, which by mine art                   120
I have from their confines call’d to enact
My present fancies.

_Fer._            Let me live here ever;
So rare a wonder’d father and a wife
Makes this place Paradise.

    [_Juno and Ceres whisper, and send Iris on employment._

_Pros._                  Sweet, now, silence!
Juno and Ceres whisper seriously;                                  125
There’s something else to do: hush, and be mute,
Or else our spell is marr’d.

  _Iris._ You nymphs, call’d Naiads, of the windring brooks,
            With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks,
            Leave your crisp channels, and on this green land      130
            Answer your summons; Juno does command:
            Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate
            A contract of true love; be not too late.

    _Enter certain Nymphs._

            You sunburnt sicklemen, of August weary,
            Come hither from the furrow, and be merry:             135
            Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on,
            And these fresh nymphs encounter every one
            In country footing.

    _Enter certain Reapers, properly habited: they join with the
    Nymphs in a graceful dance; towards the end whereof PROSPERO
    starts suddenly, and speaks; after which, to a strange, hollow,
    and confused noise, they heavily vanish._

_Pros._ [_Aside_] I had forgot that foul conspiracy
Of the beast Caliban and his confederates                          140
Against my life: the minute of their plot
Is almost come. [_To the Spirits._] Well done! avoid; no more!

_Fer._ This is strange: your father’s in some passion
That works him strongly.

_Mir._                 Never till this day
Saw I him touch’d with anger so distemper’d.                       145

_Pros._ You do look, my son, in a moved sort,
As if you were dismay’d: be cheerful, sir.
Our revels now are ended. These our actors,
As I foretold you, were all spirits, and
Are melted into air, into thin air:                                150
And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,
The cloud-capp’d towers, the gorgeous palaces,
The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,
And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,                        155
Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
As dreams are made on; and our little life
Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex’d;
Bear with my weakness; my old brain is troubled:
Be not disturb’d with my infirmity:                                160
If you be pleased, retire into my cell,
And there repose: a turn or two I’ll walk,
To still my beating mind.

_Fer._ _Mir._           We wish your peace.    [_Exeunt._

_Pros._ Come with a thought. I thank thee, Ariel: come.

  _Enter ARIEL._

_Ari._ Thy thoughts I cleave to. What’s thy pleasure?              165

_Pros._                                             Spirit,
We must prepare to meet with Caliban.

_Ari._ Ay, my commander: when I presented Ceres,
I thought to have told thee of it; but I fear’d
Lest I might anger thee.

_Pros._ Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?           170

_Ari._ I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;
So full of valour that they smote the air
For breathing in their faces; beat the ground
For kissing of their feet; yet always bending
Towards their project. Then I beat my tabor;                       175
At which, like unback’d colts, they prick’d their ears,
Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses
As they smelt music: so I charm’d their ears,
That, calf-like, they my lowing follow’d through
Tooth’d briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss, and thorns,           180
Which enter’d their frail shins: at last I left them
I’ the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,
There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake
O’erstunk their feet.

_Pros._             This was well done, my bird.
Thy shape invisible retain thou still:                             185
The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither,
For stale to catch these thieves.

_Ari._                          I go, I go.    [_Exit._

_Pros._ A devil, a born devil, on whose nature
Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,
Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;                         190
And as with age his body uglier grows,
So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,
Even to roaring.

  _Re-enter ARIEL, loaden with glistering apparel, &c._

Come, hang them on this line.

  _PROSPERO and ARIEL remain, invisible. Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO,
  and TRINCULO, all wet._

_Cal._ Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not
Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.                        195

_Ste._ Monster, your fairy, which you say is a harmless
fairy, has done little better than played the Jack with us.

_Trin._ Monster, I do smell all horse-piss; at which my
nose is in great indignation.

_Ste._ So is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should               200
take a displeasure against you, look you,--

_Trin._ Thou wert but a lost monster.

_Cal._ Good my lord, give me thy favour still.
Be patient, for the prize I’ll bring thee to
Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.             205
All’s hush’d as midnight yet.

_Trin._ Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool,--

_Ste._ There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that,
monster, but an infinite loss.

_Trin._ That’s more to me than my wetting: yet this is             210
your harmless fairy, monster.

_Ste._ I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o’er ears for
my labour.

_Cal._ Prithee, my king, be quiet. See’st thou here,
This is the mouth o’ the cell: no noise, and enter.                215
Do that good mischief which may make this island
Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,
For aye thy foot-licker.

_Ste._ Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody
thoughts.                                                          220

_Trin._ O King Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano!
look what a wardrobe here is for thee!

_Cal._ Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.

_Trin._ O, ho, monster! we know what belongs to a frippery.
O King Stephano!                                                   225

_Ste._ Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I’ll
have that gown.

_Trin._ Thy Grace shall have it.

_Cal._ The dropsy drown this fool! what do you mean
To dote thus on such luggage? Let’s alone,                         230
And do the murder first: if he awake,
From toe to crown he’ll fill our skins with pinches,
Make us strange stuff.

_Ste._ Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line, is not this
my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under the line: now, jerkin,          235
you are like to lose your hair, and prove a bald jerkin.

_Trin._ Do, do: we steal by line and level, an’t like your
Grace.

_Ste._ I thank thee for that jest; here’s a garment for’t:
wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this country.       240
‘Steal by line and level’ is an excellent pass of pate;
there’s another garment for’t.

_Trin._ Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers,
and away with the rest.

_Cal._ I will have none on’t: we shall lose our time,              245
And all be turn’d to barnacles, or to apes
With foreheads villanous low.

_Ste._ Monster, lay-to your fingers: help to bear this
away where my hogshead of wine is, or I’ll turn you out
of my kingdom: go to, carry this.                                  250

_Trin._ And this.

_Ste._ Ay, and this.

  _A noise of hunters heard. Enter divers Spirits, in shape of
  dogs and hounds, and hunt them about, PROSPERO and ARIEL setting
  them on._

_Pros._ Hey, Mountain, hey!

_Ari._ Silver! there it goes, Silver!

_Pros._ Fury, fury! there, Tyrant, there! hark, hark!              255
                        [_Cal., Ste., and Trin. are driven out._

Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints
With dry convulsions; shorten up their sinews
With aged cramps; and more pinch-spotted make them
Then pard or cat o’ mountain.

_Ari._                      Hark, they roar!

_Pros._ Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour                   260
Lie at my mercy all mine enemies:
Shortly shall all my labours end, and thou
Shalt have the air at freedom: for a little
Follow, and do me service.    [_Exeunt._






ACT V.


SCENE I. _Before the cell of Prospero._

  _Enter PROSPERO in his magic robes, and ARIEL._

_Pros._ Now does my project gather to a head:
My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time
Goes upright with his carriage. How’s the day?

_Ari._ On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,
You said our work should cease.

_Pros._                       I did say so,                          5
When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,
How fares the king and’s followers?

_Ari._                            Confined together
In the same fashion as you gave in charge,
Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,
In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;                    10
They cannot budge till your release. The king,
His brother, and yours, abide all three distracted,
And the remainder mourning over them,
Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly
Him that you term’d, sir, “The good old lord, Gonzalo;”             15
His tears run down his beard, like winter’s drops
From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works ’em,
That if you now beheld them, your affections
Would become tender.

_Pros._            Dost thou think so, spirit?

_Ari._ Mine would, sir, were I human.

_Pros._                             And mine shall.                 20
Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling
Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,
One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,
Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?
Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,             25
Yet with my nobler reason ’gainst my fury
Do I take part: the rarer action is
In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,
The sole drift of my purpose doth extend
Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:                        30
My charms I’ll break, their senses I’ll restore,
And they shall be themselves.

_Ari._                      I’ll fetch them, sir.    [_Exit._

_Pros._ Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and groves;
And ye that on the sands with printless foot
Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him                         35
When he comes back; you demi-puppets that
By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime
Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice
To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid--                           40
Weak masters though ye be--I have bedimm’d
The noontide sun, call’d forth the mutinous winds.
And ’twixt the green sea and the azured vault
Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder
Have I given fire, and rifted Jove’s stout oak                      45
With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory
Have I made shake, and by the spurs pluck’d up
The pine and cedar: graves at my command
Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let ’em forth
By my so potent art. But this rough magic                           50
I here abjure; and, when I have required
Some heavenly music,--which even now I do,--
To work mine end upon their senses, that
This airy charm is for, I’ll break my staff,
Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,                               55
And deeper than did ever plummet sound
I’ll drown my book.                    [_Solemn music._

  _Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a frantic gesture,
  attended by GONZALO; SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner,
  attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO: they all enter the circle
  which PROSPERO had made, and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO
  observing, speaks:_

A solemn air, and the best comforter
To an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains,
Now useless, boil’d within thy skull! There stand,                  60
For you are spell-stopp’d.
Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,
Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,
Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace;
And as the morning steals upon the night,                           65
Melting the darkness, so their rising senses
Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,
My true preserver, and a loyal sir
To him thou follow’st! I will pay thy graces                        70
Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly
Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:
Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.
Thou art pinch’d for’t now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,
You, brother mine, that entertain’d ambition,                       75
Expell’d remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,--
Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,--
Would here have kill’d your king; I do forgive thee,
Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding
Begins to swell; and the approaching tide                           80
Will shortly fill the reasonable shore,
That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them
That yet looks on me, or would know me: Ariel,
Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:
I will discase me, and myself present                               85
As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit;
Thou shalt ere long be free.

_ARIEL sings and helps to attire him._

    Where the bee sucks, there suck I:
    In a cowslip’s bell I lie;
    There I couch when owls do cry.                                 90
    On the bat’s back I do fly
    After summer merrily.
Merrily, merrily shall I live now
Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.

_Pros._ Why, that’s my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee;             95
But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so.
To the king’s ship, invisible as thou art:
There shalt thou find the mariners asleep
Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain
Being awake, enforce them to this place,                           100
And presently, I prithee.

_Ari._ I drink the air before me, and return
Or ere your pulse twice beat.    [_Exit._

_Gon._ All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement
Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us                        105
Out of this fearful country!

_Pros._                    Behold, sir king,
The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:
For more assurance that a living prince
Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;
And to thee and thy company I bid                                  110
A hearty welcome.

_Alon._         Whether thou be’st he or no,
Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,
As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse
Beats, as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,
The affliction of my mind amends, with which,                      115
I fear, a madness held me: this must crave--
An if this be at all--a most strange story.
Thy dukedom I resign, and do entreat
Thou pardon me my wrongs. --But how should Prospero
Be living and be here?

_Pros._              First, noble friend,                          120
Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot
Be measured or confined.

_Gon._                 Whether this be
Or be not, I’ll not swear.

_Pros._                  You do yet taste
Some subtilties o’ the isle, that will not let you
Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all!                   125
[_Aside to Seb. and Ant._]
    But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,
I here could pluck his Highness’ frown upon you,
And justify you traitors: at this time
I will tell no tales.

_Seb._ [_Aside_]    The devil speaks in him.

_Pros._                                    No.
For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother                     130
Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive
Thy rankest fault,--all of them; and require
My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know,
Thou must restore.

_Alon._          If thou be’st Prospero,
Give us particulars of thy preservation;                           135
How thou hast met us here, who three hours since
Were wreck’d upon this shore; where I have lost--
How sharp the point of this remembrance is!--
My dear son Ferdinand.

_Pros._              I am woe for’t, sir.

_Alon._ Irreparable is the loss; and patience                      140
Says it is past her cure.

_Pros._                 I rather think
You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace
For the like loss I have her sovereign aid,
And rest myself content.

_Alon._                You the like loss!

_Pros._ As great to me as late; and, supportable                   145
To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker
Than you may call to comfort you, for I
Have lost my daughter.

_Alon._              A daughter?
O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,
The king and queen there! that they were, I wish                   150
Myself were mudded in that oozy bed
Where my son lies. When did you lose you daughter?

_Pros._ In this last tempest. I perceive, these lords
At this encounter do so much admire,
That they devour their reason, and scarce think                    155
Their eyes do offices of truth, their words
Are natural breath: but, howsoe’er you have
Been justled from your senses, know for certain
That I am Prospero, and that very duke
Which was thrust forth of Milan; who most strangely                160
Upon this shore, where you were wreck’d, was landed,
To be the Lord on’t. No more yet of this;
For ’tis a chronicle of day by day,
Not a relation for a breakfast, nor
Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;                        165
This cell’s my court: here have I few attendants,
And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.
My dukedom since you have given me again,
I will requite you with as good a thing;
At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye                       170
As much as me my dukedom.

  _Here Prospero discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA playing at chess._

_Mir._ Sweet lord, you play me false.

_Fer._                              No, my dear’st love,
I would not for the world.

_Mir._ Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,
And I would call it fair play.

_Alon._                      If this prove                         175
A vision of the island, one dear son
Shall I twice lose.

_Seb._            A most high miracle!

_Fer._ Though the seas threaten, they are merciful;
I have cursed them without cause.               [_Kneels._

_Alon._                          Now all the blessings
Of a glad father compass thee about!                               180
Arise, and say how thou camest here.

_Mir._                             O, wonder!
How many goodly creatures are there here!
How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,
That has such people in’t!

_Pros._                  ’Tis new to thee.

_Alon._ What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?             185
Your eld’st acquaintance cannot be three hours:
Is she the goddess that hath sever’d us,
And brought us thus together?

_Fer._                      Sir, she is mortal;
But by immortal Providence she’s mine:
I chose her when I could not ask my father                         190
For his advice, nor thought I had one. She
Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,
Of whom so often I have heard renown,
But never saw before; of whom I have
Received a second life; and second father                          195
This lady makes him to me.

_Alon._                  I am hers:
But, O, how oddly will it sound that I
Must ask my child forgiveness!

_Pros._                      There, sir, stop:
Let us not burthen our remembrances with
A heaviness that’s gone.

_Gon._                 I have inly wept,                           200
Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you gods,
And on this couple drop a blessed crown!
For it is you that have chalk’d forth the way
Which brought us hither.

_Alon._                I say, Amen, Gonzalo!

_Gon._ Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue                 205
Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice
Beyond a common joy! and set it down
With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage
Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,
And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife                           210
Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom
In a poor isle, and all of us ourselves
When no man was his own.

_Alon._ [_to Fer. and Mir._] Give me your hands:
Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
That doth not wish you joy!

_Gon._                    Be it so! Amen!                          215

  _Re-enter ARIEL, with the _Master_ and _Boatswain_ amazedly
  following._

O, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:
I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,
This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,
That swear’st grace o’erboard, not an oath on shore?
Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?                      220

_Boats._ The best news is, that we have safely found
Our king and company; the next, our ship--
Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split--
Is tight and yare and bravely rigg’d, as when
We first put out to sea.

_Ari._ [_Aside to Pros._] Sir, all this service                    225
Have I done since I went.

_Pros._ [_Aside to Ari._] My tricksy spirit!

_Alon._ These are not natural events; they strengthen
From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?

_Boats._ If I did think, sir, I were well awake,
I’ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,                    230
And--how we know not--all clapp’d under hatches;
Where, but even now, with strange and several noises
Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,
We were awaked; straightway, at liberty;                           235
Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld
Our royal, good, and gallant ship; our master
Capering to eye her:--on a trice, so please you,
Even in a dream, were we divided from them,
And were brought moping hither.

_Ari._ [_Aside to Pros._] Was’t well done?                         240

_Pros._ [_Aside to Ari._] Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.

_Alon._ This is as strange a maze as e’er men trod;
And there is in this business more than nature
Was ever conduct of: some oracle
Must rectify our knowledge.

_Pros._                   Sir, my liege,                           245
Do not infest your mind with beating on
The strangeness of this business; at pick’d leisure
Which shall be shortly, single I’ll resolve you,
Which to you shall seem probable, of every
These happen’d accidents; till when, be cheerful,                  250
And think of each thing well.
    [_Aside to Ari._] Come hither, spirit:
Set Caliban and his companions free;
Untie the spell. [_Exit Ariel._] How fares my gracious sir?
There are yet missing of your company
Some few odd lads that you remember not.                           255

  _Re-enter ARIEL, driving in CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO,
  in their stolen apparel._

_Ste._ Every man shift for all the rest, and let no man
take care for himself; for all is but fortune. --Coragio,
bully-monster, coragio!

_Trin._ If these be true spies which I wear in my head,
here’s a goodly sight.                                             260

_Cal._ O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!
How fine my master is! I am afraid
He will chastise me.

_Seb._             Ha, ha!
What things are these, my lord Antonio?
Will money buy ’em?

_Ant._            Very like; one of them                           265
Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.

_Pros._ Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,
Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,
His mother was a witch; and one so strong
That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,                  270
And deal in her command, without her power.
These three have robb’d me; and this demi-devil--
For he’s a bastard one--had plotted with them
To take my life. Two of these fellows you
Must know and own; this thing of darkness I                        275
Acknowledge mine.

_Cal._          I shall be pinch’d to death.

_Alon._ Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?

_Seb._ He is drunk now: where had he wine?

_Alon._ And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they
Find this grand liquor that hath gilded ’em?--                     280
How camest thou in this pickle?

_Trin._ I have been in such a pickle, since I saw you
last, that, I fear me, will never out of my bones: I shall not
fear fly-blowing.

_Seb._ Why, how now, Stephano!                                     285

_Ste._ O, touch me not;--I am not Stephano, but a cramp.

_Pros._ You’ld be king o’ the isle, sirrah?

_Ste._ I should have been a sore one, then.

_Alon._ This is a strange thing as e’er I look’d on.
                                [_Pointing to Caliban._

_Pros._ He is as disproportion’d in his manners                    290
As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;
Take with you your companions; as you look
To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.

_Cal._ Ay, that I will; and I’ll be wise hereafter,
And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass                       295
Was I, to take this drunkard for a god,
And worship this dull fool!

_Pros._                Go to; away!

_Alon._ Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.

_Seb._ Or stole it, rather.    [_Exeunt Cal., Ste., and Trin._

_Pros._ Sir, I invite your Highness and your train                 300
To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest
For this one night; which, part of it, I’ll waste
With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it
Go quick away: the story of my life,
And the particular accidents gone by                               305
Since I came to this isle: and in the morn
I’ll bring you to your ship, and so to Naples,
Where I have hope to see the nuptial
Of these our dear-beloved solemnized;
And thence retire me to my Milan, where                            310
Every third thought shall be my grave.

_Alon._                              I long
To hear the story of your life, which must
Take the ear strangely.

_Pros._               I’ll deliver all;
And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales,
And sail so expeditious, that shall catch
Your royal fleet far off. [_Aside to Ari._] My Ariel, chick,       315
That is thy charge: then to the elements
Be free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near.
    [_Exeunt._





EPILOGUE.

SPOKEN BY PROSPERO.

Now my charms are all o’erthrown,
And what strength I have’s mine own,
Which is most faint: now, ’tis true,
I must be here confined by you,
Or sent to Naples. Let me not,                                       5
Since I have my dukedom got,
And pardon’d the deceiver, dwell
In this bare island by your spell;
But release me from my bands
With the help of your good hands:                                   10
Gentle breath of yours my sails
Must fill, or else my project fails,
Which was to please. Now I want
Spirits to enforce, art to enchant;
And my ending is despair,                                           15
Unless I be relieved by prayer,
Which pierces so, that it assaults
Mercy itself, and frees all faults.
As you from crimes would pardon’d be,
Let your indulgence set me free.                                    20
